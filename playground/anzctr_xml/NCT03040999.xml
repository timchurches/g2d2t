    <interventions>Other interventions - Pembrolizumab
Treatment: drugs - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Cisplatin
Treatment: other - Accelerated Fractionation (AFX) Radiotherapy
Treatment: other - Standard Fractionation (SFX) Radiotherapy

Experimental: Pembrolizumab + Cisplatin + CRT - Participants receive a priming dose of pembrolizumab before initiation of CRT (either accelerated or standard fractionation radiotherapy regimen). During CRT, participants receive 2 doses of pembrolizumab and up to 3 cycles of Cisplatin (2 cycles during accelerated and 3 cycles during standard fractionation radiotherapy). Participants also receive up to an additional 14 cycles of pembrolizumab alone as maintenance therapy for a total of 17 cycles of pembrolizumab.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo + Cisplatin + CRT - Participants receive placebo before initiation of CRT (either accelerated or standard fractionation radiotherapy regimen). During CRT, participants receive 2 doses of placebo and up to 3 cycles of Cisplatin (2 cycles during accelerated and 3 cycles during standard fractionation radiotherapy). Participants also receive up to an additional 14 cycles of placebo alone for a total of 17 cycles of placebo.


Other interventions: Pembrolizumab
Administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W)

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Normal saline solution administered as an IV infusion Q3W

Treatment: drugs: Cisplatin
100 mg/m^2 administered as an IV infusion Q3W

Treatment: other: Accelerated Fractionation (AFX) Radiotherapy
70 Gray (Gy) given in 35 fractions over 6 weeks

Treatment: other: Standard Fractionation (SFX) Radiotherapy

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab given
      concomitantly with chemoradiation (CRT) and as maintenance therapy versus placebo plus CRT in
      participants with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA HNSCC). The
      primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with CRT is superior to placebo in
      combination with CRT with respect to event-free survival (EFS) per Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR).</summary>
