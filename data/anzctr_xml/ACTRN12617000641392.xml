  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bioequivalence pilot study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing two formulations of mesalazine tablet with no health condition or problem studied. 

Although this study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the condition to which the medicine is used, mezalazine is used for the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with mild to moderate, active ulcerative colitis.</healthcondition>
    <conditioncode>
      <conditioncode1>Oral and Gastrointestinal</conditioncode1>
      <conditioncode2>Inflammatory bowel disease</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of mesalazine oral tablet (1 x 1.2 g) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of mesalazine oral tablet (1 x 1.2 g) on one occasion with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of mesalazine.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 

Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours prior to dosing. Subjects are required to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance and will be monitored for adverse events for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing. 

Each dose will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single dose, crossover pilot study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of  mesalazine  (1 x 1.2 g) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of  mesalazine  (1 x 1.2 g) on one occasion with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The comparator/control for this trial is the innovator formulation of mesalazine.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of mesalazine (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the formulation. All plasma samples will be assayed for mesalazine using one fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis. Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points.</outcome>
