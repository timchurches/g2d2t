  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Introduction of everolimus with reduced cyclosporine or tacrolimus dose, the earliest 1 month and the latest 6 months after liver transplantation.

Experimental: Everolimus based regimen - Conversion at Baseline from an immunosuppressive regimen which contains either cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (TAC) with or without mycophenolic acid (MPA), with or without corticosteroids in a regimen which contains everolimus combined reduced dose of either cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (TAC).
The dosing schedule was twice daily, 12 hours apart.


Treatment: drugs: Introduction of everolimus with reduced cyclosporine or tacrolimus dose, the earliest 1 month and the latest 6 months after liver transplantation.
Immunosuppression after liver transplantation. Pediatric transplant recipients received a starting dose of 0.8 mg/m^2/dose in combination wit Cyclosporine A or 2.0 mg/m^2/dose in combination with tacrolimus, twice-daily. Thereafter, doses were adjusted to achieve everolimus C-0h blood trough level between 3 to 8 ng/ml.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate - Month 12 - Evolution of renal function assessed by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Schwartz formula (Schwartz 2009), expressed in mean change in eGFR of CKiD between start of study (baseline assessment) and Month 12.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Failure Rates of Efficacy Endpoints - The proportion of patients with composite efficacy failure (treated biopsy proven acute rejection[tBPAR], graft loss [GL] , death [D]) before/at Month 12 and Month 24, estimated with Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods and the proportion of patients who experienced any of the components of composite efficacy failure (tBPAR, GL, D) before/at Month 12 and Month 24, separately for each component.
AR: acute rejection; BPAR: biopsy proven acute rejection. Rate = Kaplan-Meier estimate for failure in %; CI = confidence interval for failure rate.</outcome>

      <outcome>Growth Development - Height at Baseline and Month 12 - Individual growth measurements were compared with the gender and age-specific growth percentiles in the CDC growth charts for the US population. Each value observed is thus represented by the (approximated) percentage of subjects with a lower value in the reference population. Changes were calculated on this scale and thus express the change in growth measurements relative to the percentiles in the CDC growth charts.
Patients were classified into growth percentile categories (&lt;=5, &gt;5-25, &gt;25-50, &gt;50-75, &gt;75-95 and &gt;95% percentile).</outcome>
