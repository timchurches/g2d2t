  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Selexipag
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: 1 - Selexipag is up-titrated from Day 1 to Week 12 to each patient's maximum tolerated dose in the range of 200-1600 mcg twice a day (b.i.d.) in 200 mcg steps starting with one 200 mcg oral tablet on Day 1. From Day 2 onwards, a b.i.d. dose regimen with an interval of approximately 12 hours is followed. If this dose (selexipag 200 µg b.i.d.) is well-tolerated, selexipag is up-titrated with weekly increments of 200 mcg. Up-titration is followed by a stable maintenance treatment period from Week 12 onwards, up to Week 26, at the maximum tolerated dose

Placebo Comparator: 2 - Matching placebo is administered orally with a dosing interval of approximately12 h. A (mock) up-titration scheme is followed

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time From Randomization to the First Morbidity Event or Death (All Causes) up to 7 Days After the Last Study Drug Intake - Time from randomization to the first occurrence of a morbidity event or death (all causes) was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method (event-free KM estimates at different time points).
Morbidity event was defined as any of the following events confirmed by the Critical Event committee:
Hospitalization for worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH),
Worsening of PAH resulting in need for lung transplantation or balloon atrial septostomy,
Initiation of parenteral prostanoid therapy or chronic oxygen therapy due to worsening of PAH,
Disease progression which was defined by a decrease in 6-minute walk distance from baseline (&gt;=15%, confirmed by a 2nd test on a different day) combined with worsening of WHO FC for patients belonging to WHO FC II/III at baseline, or combined with the need for additional PAH-specific therapy for patients belonging to WHO FC III/IV at baseline.
Note: The number of patients at risk decreased over time but this cannot be captured below</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 7 days after end of double-blind treatment (maximum: 4.3 years)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Week 26 in 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at Trough - The 6-minute walk distance test (6MWD) is a non-encouraged test performed in a 30 m long flat corridor, where the patient is instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed. If the patient was used to taking bronchodilators before a walk, he/she was given them 5 to 30 min before the test. Also if the patient was on chronic oxygen therapy, oxygen was given at their standard rate during the test. Absolute change from baseline to Week 26 in 6MWD was measured at trough, i.e., either on the next day after the last study drug administration or at least 12 hours after study drug administration if on the same day.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 26</timepoint>

      <outcome>Absence of Worsening From Baseline to Week 26 in Modified NYHA/WHO Functional Class (WHO FC)</outcome>
