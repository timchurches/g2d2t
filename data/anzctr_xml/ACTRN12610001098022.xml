  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In treatment naïve HIV infected subjects, combination antiretroviral therapy including efavirenz combined with tenofovir and emtricitabine will offer non-inferior antiretroviral efficacy over 48 weeks, compared to either atazanavir boosted with ritonavir combined with tenofovir and emtricitabine or tenofovir and emtricitabine combined with zidovudine and abacavir, as assessed by change from baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.</summary>
