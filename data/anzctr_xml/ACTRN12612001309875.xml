  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an intervention about cardiovascular disease drugs. Participants will receive a standardised set of information about cardiovascular disease medicines during an interactive
session (using an specially designed Android tablet application and a booklet) with a nurse. The booklet can be
taken away by the participants. The session will be repeated twice (i.e. 3 times in total). The second session will take place one week after the first, and the last session will take place one month after the first session. Each session will be 40 - 60 minutes in duration. Outcome measures will  be done before and after each session. We will collect blood pressure and lipid data from clinical records and demographic data. Participants will be asked to invite any whanau members they would like to attend the session.  The following information is included in the written resource 1) for statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitor and aspirin medication groups - why these medications are taken, how to take them, side effects, and how participants know if the medicines are working.   2) general information about cardiovascular disease - what it is, how it affects the heart and brain, what can be done to manage it,what is blood pressure, what is cholesterol; 3) how to read a medicine label, 4) questions for health professionals.  The session involves an education session about the topics mentioned above.  The app is used as an interactive  teaching tool to assist in the delivery of information in these session.  One function of the app is that, after the nurse and participant enter information about each of their medications, a pill card is printed out.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is pre - post design.  Data will be collected before, during and at the end of participation in the trial.

    <concealment>After eligibility is determined potential participants will be approached by a staff member of the service who is not / has not been involved in the person’s clinical care.  The staff member will explain the study to the potential participant and ask if they are interested in participating.  If the potential participant is interested they will then be approached by the research nurse who will arrange a meeting, explain the study, provide participants information and consent forms, answer questions and, where indicated, obtain consent to participate.  Written consent to participate will be obtained before any study-specific procedures are conducted.  There is no allocation to treatment as all participants will receive the intervention.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>A health professional will deliver the standardised set of information about CVD medicines that are used to reduce the risk of future CVD events in people who have previously experienced a CVD or are at high risk of such an event in the next five years.  They will use an interactive tablet application and a written resource during their sessions with the participants.  The resources are culturally appropriate, have been designed for people with low levels of health literacy, and incorporate principles of adult education.</designfeatures>

They will use an interactive tablet application and a written resource during their sessions with the participants. We hypothesis that this will improve participants knowledge about CVD medications and will build their health literacy practices around
CVD medications especially with regard to asking questions about their CVD medicines.</summary>
