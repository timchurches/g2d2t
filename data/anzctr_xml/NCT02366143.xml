  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody
Treatment: drugs - Bevacizumab
Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - Paclitaxel

Experimental: Arm A (Atezolizumab+Paclitaxel+Carboplatin) - Participants will receive intravenous (IV) infusion of atezolizumab on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle followed by IV infusion of paclitaxel and carboplatin on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 or 6 cycles or until loss of clinical benefit whichever occurs first, during induction treatment phase. Participants will receive IV infusion of atezolizumab during maintenance treatment phase until loss of clinical benefit.

Experimental: Arm B (Atezolizumab+Bevacizumab+Paclitaxel + Carboplatin) - Participants will receive IV infusion of atezolizumab and bevacizumab on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle followed by IV infusion of paclitaxel and carboplatin on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 or 6 cycles or until loss of clinical benefit whichever occurs first, during induction treatment phase. Participants will receive IV infusion of atezolizumab until loss of clinical benefit and bevacizumab until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death during maintenance treatment phase.

Active Comparator: Arm C (Bevacizumab+Paclitaxel+Carboplatin) - Participants will receive IV infusion of bevacizumab on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle followed by IV infusion of paclitaxel and carboplatin on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 or 6 cycles or loss of clinical benefit whichever occurs first, during induction treatment phase. Participants will receive IV infusion of bevacizumab during maintenance treatment phase until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death.


Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody
Atezolizumab will be administered as IV infusion at a dose of 1200 milligrams (mg) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until loss of clinical benefit.

Treatment: drugs: Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab will be administered as IV infusion at a dose of 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death.

Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
Carboplatin will be administered at area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 6 milligrams per milliliter per minute (mg/mL/min) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 or 6 cycles or until loss of clinical benefit whichever occurs first.

Treatment: drugs: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel will be administered as IV infusion at a dose of 200 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 or 6 cycles or until loss of clinical benefit whichever occurs first.

    <summary>This randomized, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (an
      engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) in combination with
      carboplatin+paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab compared with treatment with
      carboplatin+paclitaxel+bevacizumab in chemotherapy-naïve participants with Stage IV
      non-squamous NSCLC. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A
      (Atezolizumab+Carboplatin+Paclitaxel), Arm B
      (Atezolizumab+Carboplatin+Paclitaxel+Bevacizumab), or Arm C
      (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel+Bevacizumab).</summary>
