  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Talimogene Laherparepvec
Treatment: surgery - Immediate surgical resection of melanoma lesion(s)

Experimental: Talimogene Laherparepvec - Arm 1 Talimogene laherparepvec for 6 doses followed by surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s).

Other: Surgery - Arm 2: Surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s)


Treatment: drugs: Talimogene Laherparepvec
Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection into the injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors initially at a dose of 10^6 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL at day 1 of week 1 followed by a dose of 10^8 PFU/mL at day 1 (±3 days) of week 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 or until all injectable tumors have disappeared, or intolerance of study treatment or in the opinion of the investigator, immediate surgical resection or any other treatment for melanoma is warranted, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: surgery: Immediate surgical resection of melanoma lesion(s)
Surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) will be performed after randomization any time during weeks 1 to 6.
