  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan)
Treatment: drugs - Ramipril
Treatment: drugs - Placebo of LCZ696
Treatment: drugs - Placebo of ramipril
Treatment: drugs - Valsartan
Treatment: drugs - Placebo of valsartan

Experimental: LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan) - Following randomization, patients will receive LCZ696 in titrated doses from level 1 up to level 3 (50, 100 and 200 mg twice daily).
Patients will be required to take a total of two pills, (one tablet from the LCZ696 pack and one capsule from ramipril matching placebo pack) twice a day for the duration of the study.
Patients randomized to LCZ who were previously treated with ACE inhibitors receiving the last dose of that agent during the last 36 hours prior to randomization will receive a valsartan bridge for one day. These patients will receive two doses of valsartan for 1 day in a blinded manner prior to beginning double-blind LCZ696 treatment.

Active Comparator: Ramipril - Following randomization, patients will receive the Ramipril in titrated doses from level 1 up to level 3 (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily).
Patients will be required to take a total of two pills, (one capsule from the ramipril pack and one tablet from LCZ696 matching placebo pack) twice a day for the duration of the study.
Patients randomized to ramipril who were previously treated with ACE inhibitors receiving the last dose of that agent during the last 36 hours prior to randomization will immediately start on double-blind ramipril; however, to maintain double blind/double dummy of the valsartan bridge, these patients will receive two doses of matching valsartan placebo for 1 day in a blinded manner prior to beginning double-blind LCZ696 placebo.


Treatment: drugs: LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan)
LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan) tablet will be available in 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg and 97/103 mg, respectively

Treatment: drugs: Ramipril
Ramipril 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg oral capsules

Treatment: drugs: Placebo of LCZ696
Matching placebo of LCZ696 tablets

Treatment: drugs: Placebo of ramipril
Matching placebo of ramipril capsule

Treatment: drugs: Valsartan
Valsartan (VAL489) 40 mg and 80 mg tablets, two doses for 1 day to patients who were previously treated with ACE inhibitors receiving the last dose of that agent during the last 36 hours prior to randomization

Treatment: drugs: Placebo of valsartan
matching placebo of valsartan for one day to patients who will be randomized to received ramipril

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LCZ696 titrated to a
      target dose of 200 mg twice daily, compared to ramipril titrated to a target dose of 5 mg
      twice daily, in addition to conventional post-AMI treatment, in reducing the occurrence of
      composite endpoint of CV death, HF hospitalization and outpatient HF (time-to-first event
      analysis) in post-AMI patients with evidence of LV systolic dysfunction and/or pulmonary
      congestion, with no known prior history of chronic HF..</summary>
