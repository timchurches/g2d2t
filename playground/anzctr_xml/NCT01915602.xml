  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Refametinib (BAY86-9766)
Treatment: drugs - Sorafenib (BAY43-9006)

Experimental: Refametinib and Sorafenib (Nexavar) - In Cycle 1 reduced sorafenib dose (600 mg daily; 200 mg in the morning + 400 mg in the evening) is administered, which is escalated to the standard dose in Cycle 2, if no Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), fatigue, or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities of grade 2 or higher occur. For the purposes of data recording, the treatment period will be divided into 3-week cycles. Patients will continue on treatment until at least one of the following occurs (main criteria): Progressive Disease (PD) {PD as defined by mRECIST criteria or clinical progression [e.g. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of =3], treatment may be continued past radiological progression, provided the patient derives clinical benefit as judged by the treating physician.}, Death, Unacceptable toxicity, Subject withdraws consent, Treating physician determines discontinuation of treatment is in the subject's best interest, Substantial non-compliance with the protocol


Treatment: drugs: Refametinib (BAY86-9766)
Patients will receive refametinib 50 mg (2x20 mg + 1x10mg capsules or 50 mg tablets) bid

Treatment: drugs: Sorafenib (BAY43-9006)
Patients will receive sorafenib 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) bid.

    <summary>This is a study to investigate the potential clinical benefit of refametinib when given in
      combination with sorafenib as first line treatment in patients with unresectable or
      metastatic HCC carrying a RAS mutation. The study will be conducted in 2 stages.
      Approximately 95 patients (15 at Stage 1/ 80 at Stage 2) will be accrued to this study to
      receive treatment. Stage 2 of the trial will only be conducted if at least 5 out of 15
      patients at Stage 1 show at least partial response according to an objective criteria to
      evaluate tumor size based on contrast enhancement [modified response evaluation criteria in
      solid tumors (mRECIST)] assessed by external independent radiologists.

      Refametenib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) protein kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor
      targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. By
      specifically targeting these proteins, refametinib in combination with sorafenib may stop
      cancer growth. The growth of the tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific proteins
      from functioning.

      The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on the
      rate of response, i.e. the disease getting smaller. The aim is to show that the therapy with
      refametinib in combination with sorafenib improves the response rate in this patient
      population compared to historical results observed with the sorafenib only.</summary>
