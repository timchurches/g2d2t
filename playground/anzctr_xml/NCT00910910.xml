Experimental: 1 - Lenalidomide - 1 - Lenalidomide

Active Comparator: 2- Chlorambucil - 2- Chlorambucil


Treatment: drugs: Lenalidomide
For patients with normal renal function (defined as CrCl = 60 mL/min), 5 mg once daily on Days 1 through 28 of the first 28-day cycle, 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 28 starting at the second cycle, 15 mg once daily starting at the third cycle and for the remainder of the study until PD or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.
For patients with moderate renal impairment (defined as CrCl = 30 to &lt; 60 mL/min), 2.5 mg once daily on Days 1 through 28 of the first 28-day cycle, 5 mg once daily on Days 1 through 28 starting at the second cycle, 7.5 mg once daily starting at the third cycle and for the remainder of the study until PD or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) With a Later Cut-off of 31 March 2014 - Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progression confirmed per investigator's assessment or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease included lymphadenopathy, an appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (&gt; 1.5 cm), splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates, an increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous site or an increase by 50% or more in the sum of the product of diameters of multiple nodes. The progression date was assigned to the earliest time when any progression was observed without prior missing assessments. If withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up occurred before documented progression or death, then these observations were censored at the date when the last complete tumor assessments determined a lack of progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data cut-off of 31 March 2014; up to approximately 53 months</timepoint>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - AEs = any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, regardless of cause. Serious AE (SAE) = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs were graded based upon the participants symptoms according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0); AEs were evaluated for severity according to the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild - transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention required; Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity; Grade 3 = Severe; Grade 4 = Life threatening; Grade 5 = Death</outcome>
