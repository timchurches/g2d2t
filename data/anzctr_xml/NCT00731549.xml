    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Stable Participants at Baseline Who Remained Stable at Endpoint (Last Visit). - "Stable" was defined as meeting all of the following criteria: Outpatient status; Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score = 80; Lack of specific psychotic symptoms on the PANSS as measured by a score of = 4 on each of the following items (possible scores of 1 to 7 for each item): 1) conceptual disorganization 2) suspiciousness 3) hallucinatory behavior 4) unusual thought content; Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) = 4 (moderately ill); and Clinical Global Impression for Severity of Suicidality (CGI-SS) = 2 (mildly suicidal) on Part 1 and = 5 (minimally worsened) on Part 2.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Time to First Exacerbation of Psychotic Symptoms/Impending Relapse. - Participants who first time meet relapse criteria were considered as having an event at date of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint (Last Visit) in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score. - PANSS total score (range 30-210) is the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS scale. PANSS positive subscale score (range 7-49) is the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the PANSS scale. PANSS negative subscale score (range 7-49) is the sum of the rating scores for the 7 negative scale items from the PANSS scale. The severity of each scale is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 52 and last visit</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Score. - To assess CGI-S, the rater or physician will answer the following question: "Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?" Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not ill at all; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in PANSS Positive and Negative Subscales. - PANSS positive subscale score (range 7-49) is the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the PANSS scale. Positive subscale consists of 7 positive symptom constructs: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility). PANSS negative subscale score (range 7-49) is the sum of the rating scores for the 7 negative scale items from the PANSS scale. Negative subscale consists of 7 negative symptom constructs: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive pathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking). The severity of each scale is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms.</outcome>
