  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total of 28 healthy volunteers  (18 active, 10 placebo) are planned for three treatment groups and will receive a single oral dose of ACH-0145228 or placebo.
The first dose group (Group 1) will have 12 subjects randomized to 1:1 to active and placebo (6 active:6 placebo), the remaining dose groups will have 8 subjects per cohort randomized 3:1 to active and placebo (6 active and 2 placebo).
In group 1, a sentinel group consisting of one active and one placebo subject will be dosed 24 hours before the remaining 10 subjects in group 1. If no significant drug related toxicity is identified in the first 24 hours, then remainder of Cohort 1 may be dosed. All dose escalation decisions will be made based on the review of data through Day 4 from the preceding dose.
Safety will be evaluated by monitoring and assessing AEs, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination findings, vital signs measurements, and 12-lead ECG recordings at specified time points during the study. 
The starting minimum dose of ACH-0145228 will be 40mg and the maximum dose will be 160mg.  The mode of administration will be Powder in Capsule (PIC) taken orally.</interventions>

    <sequence>A randomization schedule, using a randomized block design, will be generated by Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software procedure Plan which assigns subjects to active versus placebo treatment for each cohort, including the 2 sentinel subjects of Cohort 1.  The randomization schedule will then be loaded into the electronic data capturing (EDC) system which is utilized to create the study database.  An unblinded pharmacist (or other qualified individual) at the study site(s) who is responsible for preparing the study drugs to be dispensed for each subject will enter the appropriate subject’s information to the EDC system and obtain the treatment assignment of either active drug or placebo. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Due to the exploratory nature of this first in human study, no power or sample size calculations have been performed.  The number of subjects was chosen on an empirical basis, based on experience with other Phase 1 first-in-human studies.
There are 3 analysis populations for this study: Safety Population, Pharmacokinetic Population, and Pharmacodynamic Population.
The safety population is defined as all subjects randomized and treated with at least 1 dose of ACH-0145228 or placebo.  All safety data collected up to the end of the study are included in the safety analysis. Subjects not treated according to the randomization schedule will be analyzed according to the treatment received rather than the randomized treatment.


The Pharmacokinetic (PK) population will include all subjects treated with ACH-0145228 and for whom PK parameters can be calculated.


The Pharmacodynamic (PD) population will include all subjects treated with ACH-0145228 or placebo and for whom PD markers can be evaluated.


Pharmacokinetic analysis will be done using a validated computer program for the PK population. Based on the individual plasma concentration time data, using the scheduled sampling times, appropriate including, but not limited to, standard PK parameters of ACH-0145228 will be derived from the bioanalytical results. Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean/geometric mean, SD, med, min, and max) will be used to summarize the calculated PK parameters by dose levels.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ACH0145228 is a new orally (by mouth) administered complement factor D (fD) inhibitor being developed by Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc.for the treatment of complement mediated diseases. Many diseases are associated with inefficient control of complement or too much activity of the complement system. This study will help determine the correct dose, whether this medication has any side effects and how effective it is at controlling the
complement system.
A total of 28 subjects (18 active, 10 placebo) are planned for three treatment groups. Each healthy volunteer will receive a single dose of ACH0145228 or placebo. Subjects will remain inpatient from Day 1 to Day 4 with telephone calls on Day 5 and 6, and follow up visits (days 7, 14 and 28). The total duration of participation for each of these subjects will be approximately 28 days, not including screening.</summary>
