  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Cinacalcet
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Cinacalcet - Participants received cinacalcet at a starting dose of 30 mg orally once daily for 52 weeks. Cinacalcet dose was titrated every 4 weeks during the dose-titration phase and during study visits in the maintenance phase based on intact parthyroid hormone (iPTH) values, corrected total serum calcium values, and safety assessments.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants received placebo orally once daily for 52 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Cinacalcet
Possible sequential doses are 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Administered orally following the same dosing regimen as the experimental arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is common in people with a kidney transplant. Patients with HPT
      often have high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and may have large parathyroid glands in the
      neck. Patients with HPT can develop bone disease (osteodystrophy). This bone disease can
      cause bone pain, fractures, and poor formation of red blood cells. Other problems from HPT
      may include increases in blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia) and low blood levels of
      phosphorus (hypophosphatemia). The high calcium levels may cause calcium to deposit in body
      tissues. Calcium deposits can cause arthritis (joint pain and swelling), muscle inflammation,
      itching, gangrene (death of soft tissue), heart and lung problems or kidney transplant
      dysfunction (worsening of kidney transplant function). The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of cinacalcet (Sensipar/Mimpara) on high calcium levels in the blood in
      patients with HPT after a kidney transplant.</summary>
