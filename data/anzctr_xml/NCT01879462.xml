    <summary>GSK2878175 is a site IV NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitor (NNI) being developed for the treatment
      of chronic HCV infection. This study represents the first administration of GSK2878175 in
      humans to define safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) following single and repeat
      doses of GSK2878175 in healthy subjects.

      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to
      determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of GSK2878175 in single (Part 1) and
      repeat doses (Part 2) in healthy subjects. In addition the study will explore the effect of a
      moderate (30%) fat meal on single dose PK endpoints in healthy subjects.</summary>
