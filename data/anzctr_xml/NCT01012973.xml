Other interventions - Sham treatment

Experimental: Aflibercept Injection (EYLEA, VEGF Trap-Eye, BAY86-5321) - Participants received a 2 mg dose of Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI) administered every 4 weeks from Day 1 through Week 20, later as often as every 4 weeks depending on the study retreatment criteria from Week 24 through Week 48. Follow-up phase: Participants on IAI, who continued the study, received 2 mg dose of IAI depending on the study retreatment criteria at Week 60 and 68.

Sham Comparator: Sham treatment - Participants received sham treatment administered every 4 weeks from Day 1 through Week 52. Follow-up phase: Participants on sham treatment, who switched to Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI), received a 2 mg dose of IAI at week 52 and depending on the study retreatment criteria at Week 60 and 68.


Other interventions: Aflibercept Injection (EYLEA, VEGF Trap-Eye, BAY86-5321)
Intravitreal injection. Weeks 0 to 20 of Aflibercept Injection every 4 weeks; Weeks 24 to 52 every 4 weeks PRN (pro re nata, on demand); plus additional on Week 60 and 68.

Other interventions: Sham treatment
Sham treatment. Weeks 0 to 52 sham treatment every 4 weeks; plus additional on Week 60 and 68.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Gained at Least 15 Letters in BCVA as Measured by ETDRS Letter Score Compared With Baseline at Week 24 With Discontinued Participants Before Week 24 Evaluated as Failures - Defined study baseline range of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letter score of 73 to 24 (= Acuity of 20/40 to 20/320) in the study eye; a higher score represents better functioning. Nominator = (Number of participants who maintained vision * 100); Denominator = Number of participants analyzed.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in BCVA as Measured by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Letter Score at Week 24 - Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) - Defined study baseline range of ETDRS Best Corrected Visual Acuity letter score of 73 to 24 (= Acuity of 20/40 to 20/320) in the study eye; a higher score represents better functioning. However, because this was assessed at the screening visit, subjects may have had a higher BCVA recorded at the baseline visit and would not have been excluded from the study.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) Total Score at Week 24 - LOCF - The NEI VFQ-25 total score ranges from 0-100 with a score of 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome. The NEI VFQ questionnaire is organized as a collection of subscales which are all scored from 0-100. To reach the overall composite score, each sub-scale score is averaged in order to give each sub-scale equal weight</outcome>
