Experimental: BKM120 and paclitaxel - Adult females with histologically confirmed, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2- BC who received study drug plus paclitaxel.

Active Comparator: Placebo and paclitaxel - Adult females with histologically confirmed, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2- BC who received placebo plus paclitaxel.


Treatment: drugs: Paclitaxel
intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 per week given until progression

Treatment: drugs: BKM120 matching placebo
Buparlisib maching plaxcebo were supplied as 100 mg and 50 mg hard gelatin capsules.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS)Assessed by Local Investigator's Assessment (Phase ll) - PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the event, defined as the first radiologically documented disease progression or death due to any cause. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 8 weeks from randomization until disease progression up to 10 months after futility was analyzed</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival by Kaplan-Meier Estimate (Phase ll) - Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died by the date of analysis cut-off, OS was censored at the date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 3 months until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent to survival follow-up, up to 10 months after futility was analyzed</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate (Phase ll) - Percentage of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST v1.1. According to this criteria, CR = at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression; PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 8 weeks after randomization Up to 3 months after end of Treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (Phase Lll) - time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR, which had to be confirmed subsequently) to the date of the first radiologically documented disease progression or death due to disease</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 8 weeks after randomization Up to 3 months after end of Treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Response (Phase Lll) - time from date of randomization until first documented response (CR or PR, which has to be confirmed subsequently).</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 8 weeks after randomization Up to 3 months after end of Treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) (Phase ll) - CBR was defined as the percentage of patients with an overall response of CR or PR or SD or non-CR/non-PD lasting more than 24 weeks based on local Investigator's assessment according to RECIST v1.1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 8 weeks after randomization Up to 3 months after end of Treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma Concentration-time Profiles of BKM120 - Pharmacokinetics (PK) (Phase Lll) - Summary statistics for PK: plasma concentration-time profiles of BKM120 and appropriate individual PK parameters based on population PK model , if deemed appropriate; each cycle = 28 days</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cycle 1 day 1, 15, 16, 22 and Cycle 2 day 1.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Definitive Deterioration of ECOG Performance Status (Phase Lll) - Time to definitive deterioration of the ECOG performance status from baseline</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 4 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
