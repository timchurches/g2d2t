  <interventions>
    <interventions>The present study will be in function of "Education for functional health in the elderly with reduced mobility".
To that end, we propose data collection at the level of aerobic capacity, cognitive function, strength, balance and flexibility, and the implementation of an exercise program with the objective of training of anticipatory reaction mechanisms, dual-task and multi-task training "- importance of associated motor and cognitive training to improve functional capacity and decrease the risk of falls.
The independent variable of this study will be the introduction of specific exercises of functional training in the gymnastics class of physical activity program in the elderly, in the one that will be the experimental group. 
The program of this study will run for 12 consecutive weeks with sessions 3 times a week and 30 minutes each session. These sessions are performed with the elderly group (small group) of a day care center of the three study locations (Moselos, Lustosa and Tondelinha) included in the physical activity period of the Viseu Active program. 
The dependent variables will be the risk of falling, balance, functional and cognitive capacity of the elderly.
The program includes:
 Clarification session where all the information related to the study will be provided, and all doubts will be clarified.
 In the group that will be chosen as experimental (That is, from a single day center - Moselos), education for functional health will be introduced where a new series of functional exercises will be started every 15 days in the five areas of practice (aerobic training, balance, strength, flexibility and cognitive). At the beginning of each new series of exercises (Every 15 days are included a new series of 2 physical exercises and 2 cognitive exercises, this new series will add to the exercises previously applied in the previous series, the five areas of practice listed run simultaneously), the physiotherapist will introduce them and the remaining times will be the responsibility of the local physical activity technician apply the exercises .

    <comparator>The group that will remain as a control group, will maintain the physical activity program class in the elderly. This program consists of aerobic exercises of mobility of the upper limbs and lower limbs seated in the chair

    <statisticalmethods>The sample used in the current study was of a non-probabilistic type and chosen by convenience with a small number of participants to better control the variables applied. 
The population that will be studied includes individuals of both gender and are enrolled in the physical activity program "Viseu Ativo". 
The elderly group analyzed is composed of the participants in the physical activity "Active Viseu" program of these three localities, who attend the day centers of Lustosa, Moselos and Tondelinha, Viseu  Portugal. Of the 44 elderly participants in this program, only 24 completed the questionnaire proposed.  
The sample size was defined through the participants enrolled in the program and who agreed to participate in the present study after signed the informed consent term and the study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Piaget Institute. This study follows the recommendations of the Oviedo treaty and the Helsinki Declaration concerning human studies. 
The individuals were divided into 2 groups, randomly, the Experimental Group and the Control Group composed of 12 individuals each, integrating them according to the localities. 
Data were analysed using a statistical analysis program - Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21.0. Wilcoxon test for Non-parametric statistics were used (comparing the same group at different times), setting the level of significance at p = .05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aging is something inevitable and implies the decrease of some physical capacities, for example the balance, the decrease of flexibility, agility, joint mobility. These characteristics will lead to a decreasing of functional competence, which is central to the accomplishment of the daily life activities. Physical exercise is primordial to improve the elderly quality of life. (Rommel Almeida Fechine, 2012)
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a functional training program in the functional competence of an elderly group of people, who attend day care centers in Viseu, enrolled in the program Viseu Ativo. The program will last 12 weeks, three times a week. It will be applied an almost experimental study which will assess in two times: pre-intervention and post-intervention. (Freixo, 2009) To assess the participants it will be applied the following scales: Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), The Timed Up &amp;Go (TUG) and Bergs Balance Scale.
This study intends to check if we can increase the evaluation of the fall risk, the balance and the functional competence in the march applied to the group of people that will adopt the functional training program.
