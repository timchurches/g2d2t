  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival - Progression free survival is defined as time from randomization to progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects are followed until progressive disease/death or the end of the study. The median follow up time is 33.9 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate - Overall response rate is defined as Complete Response (CR) + Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu) + Partial Response (PR) using International Working Group Criteria (IWGC) and Independent Radiographic Review results and clinical results. The IWGC CR requires complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms, and normalization of lactic dehydrogenase and bone marrow involvement. CRu requires more than 75% reduction in sum of product of nodes (SPD). PR requires moer than 50% reduction in SPD.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects are followed until progressive disease/death or the end of the study. The median follow up time is 33.9 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Man or woman and age 18 years or older

          -  Diagnosis of follicular B-NHL of the following subtypes (World Health Organization
             [WHO] classification 1997): follicular lymphoma (FL) (Grades 1 and 2).

          -  Documented relapse or progression following prior antineoplastic treatment. New
             lesions or objective evidence of progression of existing lesions must document relapse
             or progression following the previous therapy.

        If any prior regimen included rituximab, the subject must have responded (complete response
        [CR], unconfirmed complete response [CRu], partial response [PR]), and the time to
        progression (TTP) from the first dose of rituximab must have been 6 months or more.

          -  At least 1 measurable tumor mass (greater than 1.5 cm in the longest dimension and
             greater than 1.0 cm in the short axis) that has not been previously irradiated, or has
             grown since previous irradiation

          -  In the opinion of the investigator the decision to initiate treatment is justified to
             manage the subject's lymphoma

          -  No active central nervous system lymphoma

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] status = 2

          -  Female subjects must be postmenopausal (for at least 6 months), surgically sterile,
             abstinent, or, if sexually active, be practicing an effective method of birth control
             (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, intrauterine
             device, double-barrier method, contraceptive patch, male partner sterilization) before
             entry and throughout the study; and have a negative serum beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (ß-hCG) pregnancy test at screening.

          -  Subjects (or their legally acceptable representatives) must have signed an informed
             consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures
             required for the study and are willing to participate in the study.

          -  In countries where health authorities have approved the pharmacogenomic testing,
             subjects or their legally acceptable representatives must have signed a separate
             informed consent that they agree to participate in the genetic part and protein
             testing part of the study; participation in the genetic and protein testing component
             is mandatory for pharmacogenomics testing, but optional for serum protein testing and
             future testing.</inclusivecriteria>

        participating in the study:

          -  Diagnosed or treated for a malignancy other than NHL within 1 year of randomization,
             or who were previously diagnosed with a malignancy other than NHL and have any
             radiographic or biochemical marker evidence of malignancy. Subjects with completely

             malignancy are not excluded.

          -  Known anaphylaxis or immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to murine

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of VELCADE and rituximab
      improves progression free survival relative to rituximab alone in patients with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) who never received rituximab or who have
      previously responded to rituximab. This is an international study being conducted in the
      United States and in many countries around the world. A complete list of study locations is
      listed below.</summary>
