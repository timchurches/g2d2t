  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) Including Both Systemic (i.e. Allergic/Immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated and Non-allergic) and Local Site Reactions - AEs were collected from the Baseline visit until the follow-up visit (approx. 12 weeks post-last dose). Participants were monitored to evaluate the AEs of systemic and local site reaction. AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. On treatment AEs were defined as events occurring from the first dose until 28 days after the last dose of mepolizumab.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Positive Anti-mepolizumab Binding Antibodies and Neutralizing Antibodies (NAb) at the Indicated Time Points - Blood samples were collected for the determination of anti-mepolizumab antibodies (ADA) just prior to administration of mepolizumab at indicated time points. Samples that tested positive for anti-mepolizumab antibodies were further tested for the presence of NAb. Participants who switched from the 250 mg vial to the 100 mg vial required one immunogenicity sample prior to the first dose from the 100 mg vial and one sample prior to the second dose from the 100 mg vial at the next visit. The highest value post-baseline visit are based on each participant's highest post-baseline titer. NAb assay result was only presented for participants with positive ADA assay. Highest value post-baseline would be positive for a participant who had both negative and positive post-baseline results.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annualized Rate of Exacerbations Per Year - Exacerbations are defined as the worsening of asthma which requires use of systemic corticosteroids (IV or oral steroid like prednisone, for at least 3 days or a single intramuscular (IM) corticosteroid (CS) dose is required. For maintenance systemic corticosteroids, at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days was required) and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department (ED) visit. Analysis of the number of exacerbations was performed using a negative binomial model with covariates of region, exacerbations in the year prior to the start of MEA115588 or MEA115575 (as an ordinal variable) and baseline percent (%) predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and with logarithm of time on treatment as an offset variable.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score - The ACQ-5 is a five-item questionnaire developed as a measure of participants asthma control. The five questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheeze). The response options for all these questions consist of a 0 (no impairment/limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The overall ACQ score is calculated as the mean of the 5 questions and therefore ranges between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). The change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and Baseline value.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 Over the 52-week Treatment Period - FEV1 is defined as the volume of air forcefully expelled from the lungs in 1 second. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 measurements were taken by spirometry at Baseline, Week 16, Week 28 and Week 52. Spirometry was performed within ± 1 hour of the Baseline assessment. The change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the value of the end point at the time point of interest and Baseline value.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Withdrawn Due to Lack of Efficacy and Adverse Events From the Study - AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants Hospitalized Due to Exacerbations and Adverse Events - AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Exacerbation is defined as worsening of asthma which requires use of systemic corticosteroids (IV or oral steroid like prednisone, for at least 3 days or a single intramuscular (IM) corticosteroid (CS) dose is required. For maintenance systemic corticosteroids, at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days was required) and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department (ED) visit.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Systemic (i.e., Allergic/IgE-mediated and Non-allergic) and Local Site Reactions - Participants were monitored to evaluate the AEs of systemic and local site reaction. AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Hypersensitivity reactions (i.e., allergic or IgE-mediated reactions) were monitored using the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis as outlined by the 2006 Joint NIAID/FAAN Second Symposium on Anaphylaxis. Information was also collected to assess localized site reactions as determined by the investigator. On treatment AEs were defined as events occurring from the first dose until 28 days after the last dose of mepolizumab.</outcome>
