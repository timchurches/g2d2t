    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at 12 Months Post-index Procedure. TLF is Defined as Any Ischemia-driven Revascularization of the Target Lesion, Myocardial Infarction (Q-wave and Non-Q-wave), or Death Related to the Target Vessel. - The number of participants who experience a TLF through 365 days post-procedure out of the participants who have either had a TLF within 365 days post-procedure or who were TLF-free with last follow-up at least 335 days post-procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post-index procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In-segment Percent Diameter Stenosis at 9 Months Post-index Procedure - The minimum lumen diameter in the analysis segment at 9-months post-index procedure, divided by the reference vessel diameter at baseline. The analysis segment ("in-segment") is defined as the proximal edge, stented area, and the distal edge, where each edge segment contains up to 5mm immediately outside the stent.</outcome>
