    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Distant metastasis free survival (DMFS): DMFS is defined as the time from the date of start of radiotherapy to the date of the first distant metastasis or date of death without distant metastasis. DMFS will be censored by the closeout date and the date of the last follow-up for patients lost to follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>5 years after completion of accrual.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Freedom from local progression (FFLP): FFLP is defined as the time from the date of start of radiotherapy to the date of the first local progression.  Death and distant metastasis will be considered censoring events. FFLP will be censored by the closeout date for patients alive and without progression and by the date of the last follow-up for patients lost to follow-up. </outcome>
      <timepoint>5 years after completion of accrual.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Enucleation: Enucleation will be recorded as having occurred or not. The reason for enucleation will be i) tumour progression within the eye, ii) radiation toxicity or iii) other. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual Acuity (VA) will be measured by the treating ophthalmologist using a Snellen Chart. </outcome>
      <timepoint>5 years after completion of accrual. VA is assessed at Baseline, and then annually up to 10 years.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Radiation late effects will be assessed by the ophthalmologist at clinical follow-up. The Common Terminology Criteria version 4.0 (CTC v4.0). </outcome>
      <timepoint>5 years after completion of accrual. Radiation late effects will be assessed at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after completion of radiotherapy.  There will then be annual assessment up to 10 years after completion of radiotherapy. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research project is to study whether it is possible to use a lower total dose of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) and small daily radiation treatments to treat choroidal melanoma, in order to increase the chance of keeping vision in the eye and to reduce the severity of radiation side-effects but without affecting the chance of cure. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged less than or equal to 70 years and have been diagnosed with primary choroidal melanoma (small and medium sized) by an ophthalmologist. You should not have received previous treatment to the affected eye with radiation, laser or thermotherapy. 

Study details 
All participants in this study will receive reduced dose FSRT to a dose of 60Gy in 30 fractions, given 5 fractions per week over 6 weeks. It is known that small daily doses of radiation (2Gy) will protect normal tissues from radiation injury when compared with large daily doses. When small daily doses are used it is called full fractionation. Tissues such as the eye nerve and the blood vessels at the back of the eye are especially protected by full fractionation. FSRT is a technology that makes it possible to use full fractionation to treat choroidal melanoma, so this may make it possible to reduce side-effects and keep better vision in the eye. 

Participants will be followed for up to 10 years to evaluate disease response, vision and any radiation side-effects. </summary>
