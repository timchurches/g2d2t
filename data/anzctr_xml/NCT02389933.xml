    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria

        The patient(s) for whom the MPP is sought meets all of the following:

          -  Is suffering from a serious or life-threatening disease or condition

          -  Does not have access to a comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment (i.e.,
             comparable or satisfactory treatment is not available or does not exist)

          -  Patient should be on optimized standard of care treatment, including treatment with
             ARBs or ACEI, beta-blockers and MRA;

          -  Intolerance to evidence-based target doses should be documented by the treating
             physician

          -  Meets any other relevant medical criteria for compassionate use of the investigational
             product

        Patients eligible for inclusion in this program have to fulfill all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Adult patients (but not younger than 18 year old) will be included, upon completion of
             written informed consent before any assessment is performed.

          2. Patients with a diagnosis of CHF NYHA class II-IV and reduced ejection fraction:

              LVEF = 35% at the time of screening for participation in the program (any local
             measurement, made within the past 6 months using echocardiography, MUGA, CT scanning,
             MRI or ventricular angiography is acceptable, provided there are no subsequent
             measurement above 35%)

          3. Patient had a hospitalization for HF within the last 12 months

          4. Patients must be on an ACEI or an ARB at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to
             starting treatment with LCZ696

          5. Patients must be treated with a ß-blocker, unless contraindicated or not tolerated, at
             a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with LCZ696 (reason
             should be documented for patients not on CHF target doses per local guidelines, or in
             absence of that medication).

          6. An aldosterone antagonist should also be considered in all patients, taking account of
             renal function, serum potassium and tolerability. If given, the dose of aldosterone
             antagonist should be optimized according to guideline recommendations and patient
             tolerability, and should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment

                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                  (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

         29. Any condition, not identified in the protocol that in the opinion of the treating
