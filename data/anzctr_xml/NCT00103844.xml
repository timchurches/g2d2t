    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the major cytogenetic response rates of
      BMS-354825 and imatinib (800 mg/d) in subjects with chronic phase, Philadelphia chromosome
      positive, chronic myeloid leukemia (PH+ CML) with disease resistant to imatinib at a dose of
      400-600 mg/d.</summary>
