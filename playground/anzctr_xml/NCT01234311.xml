             (Provenge) within 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment. If radiation therapy
             is applied after baseline scan, a new baseline scan needs to be done at least 4 weeks
             after the radiation therapy.

          3. Previous therapy with antiandrogens within 4 weeks (within 6 weeks for bicalutamide

          4. Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments, with the following
             exceptions:

              Ongoing treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists or
             antagonists, denosumab (Prolia) or bisphosphonate (eg, zoledronic acid) is allowed.
             Ongoing treatment should be kept at a stable schedule; however, if medically required,
             a change of dose, compound, or both is allowed.

          5. Any treatment modalities involving major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the start of
             study treatment.

          6. Prostate ca pain that requires ongoing treatment with narcotic analgesics or warrants
             the initiation of radio- or chemotherapy.

          7. Ongoing treatment with warfarin unless the international normalized ratio (INR) is
             well controlled and below 4 (Section 4.6.8.1).

             prednisone dose above 10 mg/day. The dose must have been stable for at least 5 days.

          9. Systemic exposure to ketoconazole or other strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme
             inhibitors or inducers within 14 days prior to the start of study treatment. Systemic

             study treatment.

         12. Simultaneous participation in any other study involving treatment with investigational
             drugs or having received treatment with investigational drugs less than 4 weeks prior

             host).

         17. Chronic hepatitis with advanced, decompensated hepatic disease or cirrhosis of the
             liver or history of a chronic viral hepatitis or known viral hepatitis carrier
             (patients who have recovered from hepatitis will be allowed to enter the study).

             of that therapy.)

         19. Any condition, including other active or latent infections, medical or psychiatric
             conditions, or the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which could confound the

             he participates in the study.

         20. Any patient who in the opinion of the investigator should not participate</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This is a Phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of tasquinimod in
      asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic patients with metastatic CRPC to confirm the effect of
      tasquinimod on delaying disease progression compared with placebo.

      Approximately 1200 eligible patients with metastatic CRPC will be randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: Treatment Group A (tasquinimod 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/day;
      n=800) or Treatment Group B (placebo; n=400).</summary>
