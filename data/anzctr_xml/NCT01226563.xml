          2. The subject has given informed consent.

          3. The subject has experienced a large STEMI defined by the following criteria:

             Peak cardiac enzyme value within 48 hours of symptom onset as follows:

               -  Creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) &gt; 30 x the upper limit of normal OR

               -  Troponin I &gt; 200 x upper limit of normal OR

               -  Troponin T &gt; 60 x the upper limit of normal

             AND at least 1 of the following 3 criteria:

               -  Delayed presentation with PCI &gt; 6 hours from onset of symptoms

               -  Significant new Q waves in = 2 anterior leads or anterior ST segment elevation of
                  at least 3 mm persistent at 24 hours after PCI

               -  New onset of CHF (Killip class 3-4) or cardiogenic shock persistent at 24 hours
                  after PCI

             AND at least 1 of the following 2 criteria:

               -  MI = 20% by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography scan (SPECT) or cardiac
                  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with defect in the appropriate distribution

               -  Ejection fraction = 35% with wall motion abnormality in the appropriate
                  distribution at baseline imaging assessment

          4. The subject has had successful PCI with stent within 48 hours of symptom onset, and
             residual stenosis less than 20% in the infarct related artery and greater than or
             equal to thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 2 flow. Subjects undergoing
             rescue PCI after thrombolysis or delayed presentation with ongoing ischemia may be
             enrolled.

          5. For Germany only: Patients determined to have Killip class 4 at time of device
             deployment are not eligible for randomization.

          6. For Germany only: If SPECT is used for determination of MI size in order to meet
             inclusion criteria, the SPECT must have been previously performed as part of standard
             clinical care. SPECT is not to be performed solely to qualify a patient for this study
             in Germany.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participating in this trial if ANY of the following
        exclusion criteria are met:

          1. Any subject with cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical ventilation or mechanical
             support at the time of deployment. Subject must be off mechanical support prior to
             deployment.

          2. Need for urgent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

          3. Clinically significant valvular heart disease with planned surgical correction or
             transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)

          4. Uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias

          5. Renal insufficiency with a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/ minute.
             See Appendix A for determining estimated creatinine clearance.

          6. Clinically significant hepatic insufficiency

          7. Inadequate imaging windows (defined as the inability to visualize the endocardial
             border of at least 16 of the 17 segments in both the apical four chambers and apical
             two chamber views without foreshortening) or arrhythmia that would preclude adequate
             3D imaging on transthoracic echocardiography at the local baseline echo assessment

          8. Non-ambulatory prior to the index MI

          9. The subject has participated in another trial of an investigational agent within 30
             days prior to randomization.

         10. Subject has received resorbable stent as part of PCI.

         11. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of child-bearing potential will have a
             negative urine pregnancy test prior to randomization.

         12. Any other concurrent condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent
             completion of the clinical trial, including inability to comply with follow up
             requirements.

         13. For Germany only: In the investigator's opinion, the patient is not expected to
             survive =12 months.

         14. For Germany only: 24 hours prior to device deployment, the patient has a serum calcium
             level greater than the upper limit of normal as determined by the local laboratory.</exclusivecriteria>
