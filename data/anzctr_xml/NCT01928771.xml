      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Asthma Symptom Score for Baseline Eosinophils &gt;=300/uL - Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient in the asthma daily diary. Symptom score values are from 0 (No asthma symptom) to 3 (unable to sleep because of asthma, or unable to do normal activities due to asthma), and total asthma symptom score is the sum of the daytime and night time score (0 to 6). Lower score (0) is indicating better asthma symptom, while higher score (6) is indicating worse asthma symptom. Baseline is defined as the average of data collected from the evening of study day -10 to the morning of study day 1. Each time point is calculated as bi-weekly means based on daily diary data. If more than 50% of scores are missing in a 14 day period then this is considered as missing. Symptom score lower is better.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Work Productivity Loss Due to Asthma - WPAI+CIQ (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment plus Classroom Impairment Questionnaire) contains 10 questions. Work productivity loss is derived by sum of percentage of missed work due to asthma and product of percentage of actual working hours times degree of asthma affecting work productivity while working. Percentage of missed work due to asthma is calculated by number of hours missed work due to asthma divided by total number of hours missed work plus number of hours actually worked. The work productivity loss is only applicable to patients who employed, which is only subset of the study population.</outcome>

             haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening/run-in period, which
