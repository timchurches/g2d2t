  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of ELAD® with respect
      to overall survival (OS) of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of alcohol-induced liver
      decompensation (AILD) up to at least Study Day 91, with follow-up Protocol VTI-208E providing
      additional survival data up to a maximum of 5 years that will be included, as available,
      through VTI-208 study termination (after the last surviving enrolled subject completes Study
      Day 91).

      Secondary objectives are to determine the proportion of survivors at Study Days 28 and 91.

      Exploratory objectives are to evaluate the ability of ELAD to stabilize liver function,
      measured using the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-based time to progression (TTP)
      up to Study Day 91, and the proportion of progression-free survivors (PFS) up to Study Days
      28 and 91. Progression is defined as death or the first observed increase of at least 5
      points from End of Study Day 1 MELD score (for both the ELAD and Control groups) until at
      least 24 hours after the ELAD Treatment Period is ended (end of Day 7 for Controls) and up to
      both End of Study Days 28 and 91 following Randomization.</summary>
