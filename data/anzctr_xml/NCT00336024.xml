Active Comparator: Arm I (induction+consolidation chemotherapy, autologous PBSC)) - Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, and 15; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2; cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses.
Within 6 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients receive consolidation therapy comprising carboplatin IV over 2 hours and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 2 and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or SC beginning on day 54 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients also receive autologous PBSC IV on day 4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Experimental: Arm II (induction+consolidation chemotherapy, autologous PBSC) - Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, and 15; high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 1; and leucovorin calcium IV or orally every 6 hours beginning on day 2 and continuing until methotrexate levels are in a safe range. Patients then receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on approximately days 4, 5, and 6, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on approximately days 4 and 5, and cisplatin IV over 6 hours on approximately day 6. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses.
Within 6 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients receive consolidation therapy comprising carboplatin IV over 2 hours and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 2 and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or SC beginning on day 54 and continuing until blood counts recover.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complete response (CR) rate - The analysis of response will be based on a one-sided, two-sample test of proportions, with Type I error of 10%. Tumor response criteria are determined by changes in size using all 3 dimensional measurements: width (W), transverse (T), and length (L) measurements.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to up to 4 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to treatment failure defined as disease progression or recurrence, death from any cause, or occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm - The analysis of event-free survival (EFS) will be based on a proportional hazards, non-mixture parametric cure model (PCM).
Partial stratification will be accomplished by separately estimating the scale parameter of the Weibull kernel function within each of the patient arms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity rates of acute, chronic, and late effects of the two intense regimens - Estimates will be obtained using life-table methods with an event defined as the first occurrence of toxicity. Patients who have progression or recurrence of disease will be censored in these analyses. Differences in incidence for treatment regimens will be tested with the log-rank test for overall pattern.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the beginning of treatment to end of study, assessed up to 4 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rates of gastrointestinal and nutritional toxicities - Rates of gastrointestinal and nutritional toxicities will be summarized using standard descriptive statistical methods. The two groups will be compared using a Chi-square test to detect a significant difference in complications between the two groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In each course or treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life and neuropsychological (NP) scores as assessed by the Children Oncology Group (COG) Standard Neuropsychological and Behavioral Battery - Parent-report questionnaires will be completed to gather information about the patient's function, specifically in terms of attention, memory, executive abilities, and behavioral/social/emotional adaptation. Long-term effects of treatment on neuropsychological and quality of life outcomes will be primarily descriptive. Correlational analyses will be conducted, with Pearson product moment correlations computed for continuous data and chi-square analyses conducted for discrete data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to up to 4 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gene expression profiling by northern blotting or by gel electrophoresis - The methods used by Golub and colleagues and Pomeroy and colleagues, as well as standard statistical techniques such as Cox regression analysis will be used in these analyses. Internal cross-validation procedures, such as the leave-one-out method, will be utilized in the training set to provide less-biased estimates of correct classification rates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying two different combination chemotherapy regimens
      to compare how well they work when given before a peripheral stem cell transplant in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors or
      high-risk medulloblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with a peripheral stem cell transplant
      may allow more chemotherapy to be given so that more tumor cells are killed. It is not yet
      known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective when given before a peripheral
      stem cell transplant in treating supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors or
      medulloblastoma.</summary>
