    <summary>The primary objective of study Part A is to assess the safety of talacotuzumab (formerly
      CSL362) monotherapy and confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in participants with
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for whom experimental therapy is appropriate. The primary
      objective of study Part B are to assess complete response (CR) rate and overall survival (OS)
      in participants with AML who are not eligible for intense induction chemotherapy and who are
      randomly assigned to receive decitabine plus talacotuzumab at the RP2D or decitabine alone.</summary>
