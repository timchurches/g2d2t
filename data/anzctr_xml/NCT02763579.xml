  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody
Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - Etoposide
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Atezolizumab + Carboplatin + Etoposide - Participants will receive intravenous infusions of atezolizumab 1200 milligrams (mg) in combination with carboplatin to achieve an initial target area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 milligrams per milliliter per minute (mg/mL/min) followed by etoposide 100 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4). On Days 2 and 3 of every 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4), etoposide 100 mg/m^2 will be administered alone. Thereafter, participants will receive maintenance (Cycle 5 onward) atezolizumab 1200 mg on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle until persistent radiographic PD, symptomatic deterioration, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor.

Active Comparator: Placebo + Carboplatin + Etoposide - Participants will receive intravenous infusions of placebo in combination with carboplatin to achieve an initial target AUC of 5 mg/mL/min followed by etoposide 100 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4). On Days 2 and 3 of every 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4), etoposide 100 mg/m^2 will be administered alone. Thereafter, participants will receive maintenance (Cycle 5 onward) placebo on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle until persistent radiographic PD, symptomatic deterioration, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor.


Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody
Atezolizumab intravenous infusion will be administered at a dose of 1200 mg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4) and maintenance phase (Cycle 5 onward).

Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
Carboplatin intravenous infusion to achieve an initial target AUC of 5 mg/mL/min will be administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4).

Treatment: drugs: Etoposide
Etoposide intravenous infusion will be administered at a dose of 100 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4).

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Placebo intravenous infusion will be administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle during the induction phase (Cycles 1-4) and maintenance phase (Cycle 5 onward).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, Phase I/III, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1
      [PD-L1] antibody) in combination with carboplatin plus (+) etoposide compared with treatment
      with placebo + carboplatin + etoposide in chemotherapy-naive participants with ES-SCLC.
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab + carboplatin +
      etoposide or placebo + carboplatin + etoposide on 21-day cycles for four cycles in the
      induction phase followed by maintenance with atezolizumab or placebo until progressive
      disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD
      or symptomatic deterioration.</summary>
