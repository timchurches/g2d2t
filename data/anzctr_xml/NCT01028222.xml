  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate (ORR) - ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of a confirmed complete response or partial response (CR+PR) determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (up to 39 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Durable Overall Response Rate (DORR) - DORR was defined as the rate of best overall response (CR+PR) lasting at least 12 weeks determined by RECIST v1.0 based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). The duration of ORR responders is computed from the date of first documented response (CR/PR) to the date of first documented progression or death due to underlying disease. Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no worsening of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (up to 39 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.0, as a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of all target lesions, from smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline; or a new lesion; or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (up to 39 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (up to 39 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Objective Response (TOR) - TOR was defined as the time between the start date of treatment until first documented confirmed response of CR or PR determined by RECIST v1.0 based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (up to 39 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate (DCR) - DCR was defined as the proportion of participants with an overall response of CR of any duration, PR of any duration, or stable disease (SD) for a minimum of 12 weeks from start of treatment. Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions; PD, a &gt;=20% increase in TLs, clearly worsening of non-TLs, or emergence of new lesions; SD: no change or small changes that do not meet previously given criteria for CR, PR or PD.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (up to 39 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PFS Rate - PFS was defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.0, as a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of all target lesions, from smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline; or a new lesion; or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (up to 39 months)</timepoint>
