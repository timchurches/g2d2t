          -  Participant has documented relapsed or progressive multiple myeloma on or after any
             regimen or who are refractory to the most recent line of therapy. Relapsed myeloma is
             defined as previously treated myeloma that progresses and requires initiation of
             salvage therapy, but does not meet the criteria for refractory myeloma. Refractory
             myeloma is defined as disease that is non responsive (failure to achieve minimal
             response or development of progressive disease [PD]) while on primary or salvage
             therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy.

          -  Participant must have received prior treatment with at least one, but no more than
             three, prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma. A line of therapy consists of
             greater than or equal to 1 complete cycle of a single agent, a regimen consisting of
             combination of several drugs, or a planned sequential therapy of various regimens.

             inhibitor, defined as no disease progression (i.e., PD, per IMWG or European Society
             for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [EBMT] criteria) while receiving proteasome
             inhibitor therapy or within 60 days after the last dose, AND best response achieved
             with any proteasome inhibitor therapy (alone or in combination) was at least a PR, AND
             participant did not discontinue any proteasome inhibitor due to intolerance or greater
             than or equal to Grade 3 related toxicity.

          -  Participant has measurable disease at Screening, defined as at least one of the
             following: Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 0.5 g/dL, OR Urine M-protein
             greater than or equal to 200 mg in 24-hours, OR serum immunoglobulin free light chain

        cells by standard differential, waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, amyloidosis, POEMS

        affect the participant's participation in the study

          -  Participant has a history of other active malignancies, including myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS), within the past 3 years prior to study entry, with the following

             basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             prostate cancer Gleason grade 6 or lower AND with stable Prostate Specific Antigen
             (PSA) levels off treatment, previous malignancy with no evidence of disease confined
             and surgically resected (or treated with other modalities) with curative intent and
             unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the study
