  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) simplex is a rare orphan disease caused by a mutation in DNA
      leading to abnormal dominant keratins in the skin. Patients with EB simplex develop lifelong
      painful thick soles on their feet, and current standard of care is supportive. This pilot
      study will target the dominant mutant keratin proteins in the skin to ameliorate the severity
      of EB simplex. The purpose is to improve the function of EB simplex feet with an application
      of topical sirolimus, 2%. The investigators plan on inhibiting the mTOR pathway to down
      regulate the translation of defective keratin proteins and work through anti proliferative
      pathways.</summary>
