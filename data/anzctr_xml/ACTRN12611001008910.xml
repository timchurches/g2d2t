  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of PBT2 compared to placebo on brain amyloid levels after 52 weeks of treatment as measured by Carbon 11-Pittsburgh Imaging Compound-B (PiB) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 26 and 52 weeks after commencement of treatment with PBT2/placebo</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PBT2 compared to placebo as measured by capture of vital signs, physical examination, neurological examination, ECG, eye examination, blood haematology and biochemistry, urinalysis and recording of adverse events. 
From previous clinical trials, the most commonly reported side effects that were possibly related to PBT2 were fatigue (tiredness), headache, dizziness, nasopharyngitis (swollen blocked nose), and somnolence (drowsiness). Less common side-effects possibly related to PBT2 were diarrhoea, back pain, nausea and pharyngolaryngeal (throat) pain.  It is possible that a rare side effect may be dissociation (a feeling of disconnecting from one's thoughts, feelings, memories or self).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>Baseline and 52 weeks after commencement of of treatment withPBT2/placebo</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase II clinical trial to examine the safety, tolerability and effect of 52 weeks treatment with PBT2 in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary objective is to compare the effect of PBT2 vs placebo on the amount of amyloid in patients brains after 52 weeks of treatment when measured by a particular type of brain scan, PiB-Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The effects of PBT2 on safety and tolerability, brain volume, brain metabolic activity, and cognition plus functional abilities will also be investigated.</summary>
