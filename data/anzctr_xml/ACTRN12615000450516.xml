  <interventions>
    <interventions>Four to six home visits by dental assistants previously trained in motivational interview covering oral health.
Motivational interview involves an initial assessment about dental care (hygiene and other habits), according to this assessment the dental assitants will motivate to change behaviors using techniques like: identifying the problems of the patients, reflective listening, open ended questions, summary statements, and providing affirmations.
The complete procedure takes 3 to 6 weeks. The frequency of visits is one per 7-to-14 days.
The mode of administration includes (by invitation) to all members of families (parents, children and other adults) present in the house at the moment of the visit.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: Was considered values based on the incidence of caries in Chilean preschoolers. The calculation was performed in four steps:
1. T test for two independent samples (two-sided test, alpha = 5%, power = 80% , minimum of 2 units to detect difference, assuming a common standard deviation of 4.00) to give an ni equal to 64 preschoolers.
2. The design effect associated with random assignment of groups was calculated as follow: 1 + (ni - 1) * (intragroup correlation coefficient = 0.01) equal to 1.63.
3. The loss rate was estimated in 15%.. 
4. Finally the required sample is 64 * 1,63 * 1,15 equal to 120 preschoolers per group.

Statistical analysis: Univariate description of socioeconomic, clinical and oral health literacy variables (baseline and post-intervention) shall be made using frequency tables (qualitative variables), summary measures (central tendency and dispersion) for quantitative variables, accompanying with relevant graphics (circular, bars and histograms). 
To analyze the association between qualitative variables chi-square test will be used, and for the association of quantitative variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient will be used. 
In case of failure to achieve the necessary assumptions of parametric tests, the corresponding nonparametric tests were used. 
Regarding the examiners calibration, Kappa or Lin indices will be used according to the nature of the variables.
For all analysis will be considered an alpha = 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to determine the health impact measured by the incidence of caries and literacy levels in oral health after 12 months of an intervention in oral health promotion through the motivational interview compared to the traditional way to deliver oral health promotion in kindergarten. 
An experimental community trial is proposed in two urban areas of low socioeconomic status in the province of Concepcion: Los Cerros in Talcahuano and Boca Sur in San Pedro de la Paz. Both sectors are covered by public kindergartens (JUNJI or INTEGRA) that promote oral health in traditional ways (TW). The promotion intervention in households consist of 4 to 6 visits by a dental assistant previously trained for two months in the delivery of a standardized oral health promotion through the technique of motivational interviewing (MI). 
The experimental group will receive TW and MI, whereas the control group only TW. If it is found a positive and significant effect of MI, this will be administered to the control group. For a 50% reduction in the incidence of caries a sample size of 120 preschoolers per group was estimated.
The project involves the implementation of activities spread over 7 phases to develop during the 24 months, as follows: 1. Preparation of the team; 2. Measurement of baseline data; 3. Implementation of the intervention; 4. Waiting Period; 5. Measurement of post-intervention data; 6. Analysis of the data; and 7. Generation products. 
The outcome variables assessed at follow-up corresponding to the difference in the experimental and control groups in the incidence of caries in preschool and change in oral health literacy of parents and/or caregivers.</summary>
