Tumor assessment will be performed using radiographic evaluations.</outcome>

    <summary>This Phase III, open-label, randomized, multicenter study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab compared with observation in participants with
      muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC) who are at high risk for recurrence following
      resection. Eligible participants will be randomized by a 1:1 ratio into atezolizumab group or
      control group.</summary>
