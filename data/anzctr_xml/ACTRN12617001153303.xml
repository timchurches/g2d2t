    <interventions>Brief name: Flotation-REST (restricted environmental stimulation technique)
Flotation-REST treatment means floating on the back inside of a dark and quiet isolation tank, filled with salt saturated water. The high salt content in the water gives high buoyance, which makes possible to float on top of the water. By keeping the water at skin-temperature, sensory input to the somato-sensory system is reduced. The treatment is delivered individually and the participants are alone in the room with the tank. Instructions on how to use the flotation tanks will be given by a doctoral student in psychology with substantial experience in flotation research. A project assistant (grad student) will meet with the participants briefly before and after each session in order to unlock the facilities and to receive any completed questionnaires that the participants brings with them to be handed in. The project assistant will also alert the participants that sessions have finished, by knocking on the door to the flotation room. 

Intervention adherence is assessed in that the project assistant will know whether or not participants show up for their appointment. As the assistant is responsible for unlocking and locking the room the assistent observes the participants entering the float tank room, as well as leaving the room. In case of cancelled appointments, care will be taken to schedule new appointments as soon as possible. 

The float tanks (270 cm x 150 cm x 130 cm) are situated in quiet rooms at Karlstad University (Sweden). The float tanks contains water (0.3 m in depth) held at skin temperature (35 degrees Celsius) that are saturated with Epsom salt (magnesium sulphate). The float tanks are insulated to minimize visual and auditory stimuli, and earplugs are used during the float sessions. Toilet and shower can be accessed in the float rooms and the float rooms can be locked from inside by the participants. The participants will be instructed to keep the light out during the float session, and to shower before and after each session. The treatment consists of 12 sessions (á 45 minutes) of flotation-REST over a seven-week period, with two sessions a week. The fourth week is treatment free, in order to simulate the break needed by menstruating participants.

    <comparator>In single case experimental designs, each participant acts as their own control. The baseline values from a pre-intervention period is compared to daily measures over the treatment period. The participants' data from two weeks of baseline will be compared to data from seven weeks of treatment. </comparator>

    <designfeatures>When designing the study, care was taken to closely follow general quality criteria of single case experimental designs (SCED), meaning for example (but not limited to) sufficiently defined outcome criteria, long enough baseline period, randomisation of treatment start times, a minimum of five observations in each study phase for main outcome variables (baseline, treatment, and follow-up), and intersubject replication (multiple participants). Due to assumed irreversible effects of the therapy, intrasubject replication (varying baseline with treatment phases several times) was not conducted.  </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In SCED, conclusions are strengthened by the replication of findings over several participants. Guidelines sometimes mention at least three or five participants. Ten participants would allow for some potential attrition, thus this number was chosen.
The most established way of reporting results from single case studies is through graphs (so-called visual inspection). The basic idea is that if any significant change has occurred, it will be clearly visible. The result of daily sleep measurements will therefore primarily be reported visually, and in accordance with established recommendations for how single case graphs should be presented to present results in a clear and correct manner. However, one should decide on what kind of visual differences that are meaningful for the current research question. Therefore, in the case of daily measurements of sleep, it is relevant to mark the number of nights where involuntarily time awake before falling asleep or in the middle of the night exceeds 30 minutes (frequently used research and diagnostic criteria at insomnia). If the occurrence of these nights decreases after treatment, then a clinically meaningful change has occurred. As statistical calculations are becoming increasingly common in SCED  and required by newer guidelines, we plan to follow the methodological development and complement graphs report with appropriate statistical calculations. We refrain from deciding on a specific statistical method at this point, as we are currently investigating which would be the most appropriate method, but it is likely that the choice falls on a version of "time-series analysis" or "percentage of non-overlapping data" which can handle the specific mathematical circumstances that apply to SCED data, such as autocorrelation and variability within one phase. Results from questionnaires will be presented in tables. In cases where clinically significant differences have occurred, this will be highlighted.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During Flotation-REST, a person is floating inside a quiet and dark tank, filled with heated salt saturated water. Deep relaxation and beneficial effects on e.g. stress, sleep difficulties, anxiety and depression have been documented in earlier research but the effects from Flotation-REST had never before been studied on participants with insomnia. Our aim is to investigate the effects from Flotation-REST on sleep for people with insomnia disorder, by using sleep diaries, insomnia-related questionnaires, questionnaires for potential treatment mechanisms and as well as clinical and qualitative interviews</summary>
