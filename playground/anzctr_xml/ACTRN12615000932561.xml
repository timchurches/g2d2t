  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experimental group A: Proactive Telephone Delivered Support.
Patients will receive a 10-50 minute outbound call from a trained Helpline consultant. The Helpline consultant will also offer an additional, subsequent call-out. Following the completion of the two proactive calls from the Helpline, patients in this group can initiate further contact with the CCNSW Helpline if desired. While most contact is concluded within 3 months, there is no time limit on contact with the Helpline. 
Call content will reflect usual Helpline care. Currently the Helpline offers accurate and up to date verbal and written information on cancer prevention, early detection and treatment; links callers with services in their local area; and provides low-intensity emotional support. When patient distress is high or medical advice is required, referral to relevant services within or outside the CCNSW will be offered. Patients families or support persons will also be eligible to receive a call-out or make call-ins to the study Helpline number if desired. All calls will be logged using the existing client record management system.
Experimental group B: Proactive Online Delivered Support. 
Usual Helpline content (as described above) will be provided via typed rather than spoken communication, using email and on-line chat. The first contact to participants allocated to this intervention arm will be via email from the CCNSW Helpline consultant. The email will explain the available electronic options for support (email delivered or on-line typed live chat). The same information will also be sent by hard-copy surface mail. Participants will be able to use either or both modes of electronic contact according to their preference. Following their first electronic session, participants will be offered an additional email contact from the CCNSW Helpline. As in Arm A, patients families or support persons will be eligible to receive online support from the Helpline if desired. Most contact will be concluded within a 3 month period, however there is no tie limit on contact with the Helpline.  All email and on-line contact will be logged within the existing client record management system.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ12) uses 12 items to assess an individuals perception of their health in terms of their ability to: play a useful part; make decisions; overcome difficulties; enjoy normal activities; face problems; and to feel confident, worthwhile, and happy. The time-frame of the GHQ-12 covers the last 4 weeks and items are scored using a four point scale (Better than usual, Same as usual, Less than usual, Much less than usual). Half of the items are worded positively, and the other half negatively. Items can be scored using either a Binary scale (0-1, maximum score = 12) or Likert scale (0-3, maximum score = 36), with a higher score indicating higher psychological distress. </outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The heiQ (trademark) is an Australian-developed tool for assessing the efficacy and impact of health education and self-management programs for people with chronic diseases. Its 42 items are closely aligned to the nature of the Helpline intervention and map to 8 eight domains: 1) health directed behaviour; 2) positive and active engagement in life; 3) emotional well-being; 4) self-monitoring and insight; 5) constructive attitudes and approaches; 6) skill and technique acquisition; 7) social integration and support; and 8) health service navigation. Respondents indicate the degree to which they agree or disagree with each item on a 4 point scale. Standardised subscale scores (from 1 to 4) are calculated, with higher scores indicating better functioning. </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post-recruitment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Unmet needs: Two subscales of the 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34) will be used. The scale assesses cancer-specific perceived needs across five, factor analytically derived domains. The two relevant domains for this study are: 1) health systems and information; and 2) patient care and support. Respondents indicate their level of need for help over the last month on a five point Likert scale. Standardised domain scores ranging from 0 to 100 can be calculated</outcome>

    <concealment>Cancer Care Coordinator/nurses/clinicians will identify potentially eligible patients on their daily clinic appointment lists. The participant is enrolled via one of 3 approaches:
1.	 When the patient checks in for their appointment, reception staff or a research assistant will ask the patient whether they have internet access, provide study information materials to eligible patients, and invite them to participate in the study.
2.	When the patient checks in for their appointment, reception staff will ask whether they have internet access and if they would be interested in being contacted by the research team regarding the study. Interested patients will be asked to complete a consent form for permission of the clinic to forward the patient’s contact details to the research team. Once consent forms are forwarded to the research team, patients will be contacted to discuss participation. Up to two follow-up contacts will be made to non-respondents. Patients who would like to participate in the study will be asked to complete a consent form to participate in the trial. 
3.	The staff member will mail information and make follow-up telephone calls to patients as part of standard care procedures. As part of these standard contacts, study materials (Information Statement and Consent Form) will be included mail-out package, and the staff member may also discuss the study when making calls to patients.
Once consent is obtained and the baseline survey is returned to the research team, the patient is randomised by the research team  using central randomisation by computer to one of the three study groups (telephone support, on-line support or booklet only).

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation is based on the post-hoc contrasts. The comparison of each intervention group with minimal ethical care is a superiority analysis, whereas the comparison of the two intervention arms of the study  is a non-inferiority analysis. The study aims to recruit 200 subjects per arm and therefore complete data will be available for approximately 150 patients at 6 months if we allow for a 25% loss to follow-up. This sample size will provide the study with more than 80% power to detect a difference between each of the intervention groups and the control group of 0.3 SD at an alpha level of 0.01 assuming the correlation between baseline and follow-up scores is at least 0.7. Effect sizes of 0.3-0.5 on the heiQ have been achieved in self-management interventions with hospital patients. This sample size will also provide the study with 90% power to claim non-inferiority in the comparison between the two interventions if the true underlying difference between the groups is 0.25 SDs for either the heiQ or GHQ-12.

Structural equation modelling will be used to develop models which relate to each of the study hypotheses. It is hypothesised that at 6 months follow-up: 
1)	Those in each of the two experimental conditions (Proactive Telephone Delivered Support and Proactive Online Delivered Support) will have GHQ-12 scores that are 0.3 of a standard deviation higher than those for the control condition and heiQ scores that are 0.3 of a standard deviation higher than those for the control condition; and 
2)	Those in the Proactive Online Delivered Support condition will have heiQ scores within 0.25 of a standard deviation of those in the Proactive Telephone Delivered Support condition.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether proactive telephone or online support for lung cancer patients can improve patient wellbeing.

Who is it for?
 You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over, have been diagnosed with any form of lung cancer in the past 4 months and have internet access on any device. 

Study details
 Lung cancer patients often experience poorer prognosis, more severe physical effects and more pronounced psychosocial distress than patients with other major cancers. A highly accessible and sustainable source of personalised support for cancer patients is the Cancer Council Helpline in each state. Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either telephone support including at least 1 telephone call from the Helpline, Online support by email or live web chat including at least 1 email from the Helpline, or to receive a booklet 'Understanding lung cancer' in the mail. Helpline support provided to the telephone and email support groups includes information, linking callers with services in their local area, and providing emotional support. When patient distress is high or medical advice is required, referral to relevant services within or outside the Cancer Council will be offered. 

All participants will be asked to fill out a mailed questionnaire at 3 and 6 months after their enrolment in the study. It is hoped that this study will provide evidence of whether a proactive approach can recruit a high proportion of lung cancer patients to Helpline, whether the Helpline model of information and support is effective in improving wellbeing, and whether an electronic approach can provide equivalent outcomes to a telephone-based approach. These results will have national and international relevance for decisions about community-based information and support.
