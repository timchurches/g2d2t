    <inclusivecriteria>Main Inclusion at Screening (Visit 1):

          -  Subject has completed study 178-CL-101 or study 905-EC-012 (This inclusion criterion
             will no longer apply once the recruitment for study 178-CL-101 and study 905-EC-012
             has been completed. In that case the subject has to have symptoms of "wet" OAB
             (urinary frequency and urgency with incontinence) for at least 3 months);

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete the micturition diary and questionnaires
             correctly and able to measure his/her vital signs at home at stipulated time points,
             using the device provided by the study personnel, and to adequately record the
             readings;

        Main Inclusion at Randomization (Visit 2):

          -  Subject has a micturition frequency of on average = 8 times per 24-hour period during
             the last 7 days of the micturition diary period (incontinence episode should not be
             counted as a micturition).

          -  Subject has experienced at least 3 incontinence episodes during the last 7 days of the
             micturition diary period.

          -  Subject has experienced on average at least 1 urgency episode (grade 3 or 4 on Patient
             Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale [PPIUS]) per 24-hour period during the 7-day
             micturition diary period.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Main Exclusion at Screening (Visit 1):

          -  Subject has clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction at risk of urinary
             retention;

          -  Subject has significant PVR volume (&gt; 150 mL);

          -  Subject has significant stress incontinence or mixed stress/urgency incontinence where
             stress is the predominant factor;

          -  Subject has an indwelling catheter or practices intermittent self-catheterization;

          -  Subject has evidence of a UTI (urine culture containing &gt; 100,000 cfu/mL), chronic
             inflammation such as interstitial cystitis, bladder stones, previous pelvic radiation
             therapy or previous or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs;

          -  Subject has had intravesical treatment in the past 12 months with e.g., botulinum
             toxin, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin;

        Main Exclusion at Randomization (Visit 2):

          -  Subject has evidence of a UTI (urine culture containing &gt; 100,000 cfu/mL) as assessed
             in the Screening visit (V1) samples. The subject can be rescreened after successful
             treatment of the UTI (confirmed by a dipstick negative for nitrite).

          -  Subject had an average total daily urine volume &gt; 3000 mL as recorded in the
             micturition diary period.</exclusivecriteria>
