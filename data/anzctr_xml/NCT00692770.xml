  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) by Independent Assessment - Disease recurrence of HCC (intra or extra hepatic) was defined as the appearance of a new intrahepatic lesions fulfilling the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria of diagnosis of HCC or a new extra-hepatic lesions according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. In addition to investigator assessment, all images were reviewed by an independent panel of radiologists. The calculation of the RFS was based on the independent evaluation of the scans. RFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence by independent radiological assessment or death due to any cause whichever occurred first. For subjects who had not recurred or died at the time of analysis, RFS was censored at their last date of evaluable scan before drop-out for any other reason than recurrence or death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 4 years or until disease recurrence whichever came first</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Recurrence (TTR) by Independent Assessment - TTR was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence by independent radiological assessment. For subjects who had not recurred at the time of analysis, TTR was censored at their last date of evaluable scan before withdrawal for any other reason than recurrence. "NA" in the reported data indicates values could not be estimated due to censored data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 4 years or until disease recurrence whichever came first</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to any cause. OS for subjects alive at the time of analysis was censored at their last date of contact. "NA" in the reported data indicates values could not be estimated due to censored data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first subject until 4 years later.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects who have undergone surgical resection or local ablation (PEI or percutaneous
             or intraoperative RFA) for treatment of HCC with curative intent within 4 months from

             be administered during this time period.
