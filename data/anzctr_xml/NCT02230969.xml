      <outcome>Disability progression as measured by the proportion of participants with sustained progression for at least six months - Disability progression measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. Participants with confirmed progression of disability in EDSS physical functional system scores will be defined as those who meet one of the following criteria: an increase of = 1 point from baseline system score of = 1 or an increase of = 2 points from baseline system score of 0 in at least 2 physical functional systems, or an increase of = 2 points from baseline system score of = 1 or an increase of = 3 points from baseline system score of 0 in any 1 physical functional system. Worsening must be confirmed on a subsequent examination using the same criterion in the same functional system(s) at least 6 months later.</outcome>

      <outcome>Changes in EuroQoL EQ-5D, 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) score over time - The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It is a health questionnaire that consists of 2 pages - the EQ-5D descriptive system (page 2) and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) (page 3). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of the study are to determine the incidence of serious adverse events
      (SAEs) in participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in routine clinical
      practice and to assess the overall long-term clinical effectiveness of Plegridy in
      participants with relapsing forms of MS in routine clinical practice. The secondary
      objectives of this study in this study population are to describe Plegridy prescription and
      utilization adherence patterns in routine clinical practice; to assess the specific long-term
      clinical effectiveness of Plegridy in participants with relapsing forms of MS in routine
      clinical practice; to monitor the safety and tolerability of Plegridy in routine clinical
      practice by assessing the incidence of adverse events (AEs) of flu-like symptoms (FLS),
      injection site reactions (ISRs), and AEs (including laboratory abnormalities) leading to
      treatment discontinuation; to assess the effect of FLS on participant-reported effectiveness
      of, and satisfaction with, prophylactic management using a FLS-Visual Analog Scale (FLS-VAS);
      to evaluate the change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), FLS, FLS-VAS, healthcare
      resource consumption, and treatment adherence over time.</summary>
