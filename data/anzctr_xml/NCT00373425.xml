  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Free Survival (DFS) - DFS is the time from the date of randomization until the first day non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relapse is documented by radiological exam and/or biopsy, or until death in the absence of relapse. After randomization, NSCLC relapse was based on radiological evidence or biopsy, as determined by the investigator. Participants without a DFS event were censored on the last adequate radiological assessment date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 months during active phase and every 6 months during long term follow-up up to 5 years and yearly thereafter until the data cut-off date of 08 April 2013 (maximum time on follow-up was 64 months).</timepoint>

      <outcome>Disease-free Survival in Participants With EGFR Mutation - Positive Tumors - Disease-free survival (DFS) is the time from the date of randomization until the first day NSCLC relapse is documented by radiological exam and/or biopsy, or until death in the absence of relapse. After randomization, NSCLC relapse was based on radiological evidence or biopsy, as determined by the investigator. Participants without a DFS event were censored on the last adequate radiological assessment date. Activating EGFR mutation-positive is defined as exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R (or both) detected.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant and did not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.
An AE was considered serious if it resulted in death, a life-threatening situation, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant, other important medical events, or is on the Astellas Always Serious List.
A drug-related AE was any AE with at least a possible relationship to study treatment as assessed by the investigator. Severity was graded by the investigator according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v3.0, where Grade 1=Mild AE; Grade=2 Moderate AE; Grade 3=Severe AE; Grade 4=Life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5=Death related to AE. AEs leading to death include deaths that occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose. The median time on treatment was 11.9 months for erlotinib and 21.9 months for placebo. Data are based off the 11 June 2014 data cut-off date.</timepoint>
