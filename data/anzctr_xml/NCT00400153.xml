    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of ipratropium
      bromide/salbutamol inhalation spray combination administered by the Respimat® inhaler (20
      mcg/100 mcg), ipratropium bromide inhalation spray administered by the Respimat® inhaler (20
      mcg), and COMBIVENT® MDI administered q.i.d on FEV1 at intervals over a treatment period of
      12 weeks in patients with COPD. Specifically, non-inferiority of Combivent Respimat® to
      COMBIVENT® MDI in FEV1 AUC from 0 to 6 hours , superiority of Combivent Respimat® to Atrovent
      Respimat® monotherapy in FEV1 AUC from 0 to 4 hours, and non-inferiority of Combivent
      Respimat® to Atrovent Respimat® monotherapy in FEV1 AUC from 4 to 6 hours will be analyzed.
      In addition, steady state pharmacokinetics over one dosing interval following 4 weeks of
      therapy will be characterized in a subgroup of patients.</summary>
