  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease-free Survival (DFS) - DFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of event defined as the first documented relapse of the disease or death due to any cause. Relapse was based on investigator assessment and was assigned only if: It was documented according to Cheson guidelines by an objective radiological assessment method; It was documented by a biopsy proven lymphoma including new or recurrent bone marrow involvement; A new anticancer therapy for lymphoma started with subsequent confirmation of the relapse within 4 weeks of the start of this anticancer therapy</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization to the date of event defined as the first documented recurrence of the disease, or death due to any cause and up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If the patient was not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of the last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization to date of death due to any cause up to around 7 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lymphoma-specific Survival (LSS) - LSS was defined as time from randomization to death as a result of lymphoma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization to death documented as a result of lymphoma up to 7 years</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Patients with previous histologically confirmed Stage III-IV (or Stage II bulky
             disease, defined as any tumor mass more than 10 cm in longest diameter), at time of
             original diagnosis, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (pathology report based on original
             tumor tissue/lymph node is acceptable for meeting inclusion criteria, but tumor tissue
             (slides/block) must be available to be sent for central pathology to confirm
             diagnosis).

          2. Patients defined as poor risk with IPI of 3, 4, or 5 at time of original diagnosis.

          3. Patients age = 18 years old.

          4. Patients must have achieved complete remission (CR) based on the revised IWRC (Cheson
             et al 2007) following first line R-chemotherapy treatment. Radiation therapy (RT)
             during or after R-chemotherapy is acceptable provided: 1) it ends 4 weeks prior to
             start of study drug and, 2) in case of consolidation RT targeted at initial bulky
             tumor mass, administered after R-chemotherapy, patient is already in CR before
             initiating RT. Complete remission from R-chemotherapy must be confirmed by clinical
             and radiologic evaluation along with bone marrow confirmation (if bone marrow was
             involved by lymphoma before the R-chemotherapy treatment). Local pathology report on
             the bone marrow biopsy is acceptable. If bone marrow was not involved by lymphoma
             before R-chemotherapy treatment, then bone marrow confirmation after R-chemotherapy is
             not required.

          5. Patients who received a minimum 5 cycles of R-chemotherapy treatment and maximum 8
             cycles of R-chemotherapy treatment. Any variation of CHOP (R-CHOP-14, R-CHOP-21) is
             acceptable. Liposomal doxorubicin, epirubicin, or pirarubicin (also known as
             therarubicin) is acceptable. R-EPOCH is acceptable.

               -  Hemoglobin = 9 g/dL (can be achieved by transfusion)

               -  Total bilirubin = 2 x ULN (if &gt;2 x ULN direct bilirubin is required and should be

         10. Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test 14 days
             prior to the start of study drug plus a negative local urine pregnancy test on Day 1,
             Cycle 1 prior to treatment and must be willing to use adequate methods of
             contraception during the study and for 8 weeks after study drug administration.
