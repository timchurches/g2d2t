Active Comparator: T+OFS - Ovarian function suppression (OFS) by triptorelin (GnRH analogue) 3.75mg by im injection q28 days for 5 years plus tamoxifen 20mg orally daily for 5 years. Tamoxifen (T) begins after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy if given, or approximately 6-8 weeks after the initiation of triptorelin. Bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation was allowed after at least 6 months of triptorelin.

Experimental: E+OFS - Ovarian function suppression (OFS) by triptorelin (GnRH analogue) 3.75mg by im injection q28 days for 5 years plus exemestane 25mg orally daily for 5 years. Exemestane (E) begins after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy if given, or approximately 6-8 weeks after the initiation of triptorelin. Bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation was allowed after at least 6 months of triptorelin.

    <summary>RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      triptorelin, exemestane, and tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of
      estrogen. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin together with exemestane is more
      effective than triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying triptorelin and exemestane to see how
      well they work compared to triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating premenopausal women with
      hormone-responsive breast cancer.</summary>
