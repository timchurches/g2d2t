    <exclusivecriteria>-  Recipient of a live donor kidney or a kidney from a donation after cardiac death (DCD)
             donor.

          -  Recipient of donor kidney preserved with normothermic machine perfusion.

          -  Scheduled to undergo multiorgan transplantation.

          -  Has planned transplant of dual kidneys (from the same donor) transplanted not en bloc.

          -  Has lost first kidney transplant due to graft thrombosis.

          -  Is scheduled for transplantation of a kidney from a donor who is known to have
             received an investigational therapy under another IND/CTA for ischemic/reperfusion
             injury immediately prior to organ recovery.

          -  Is scheduled to receive an ABO-incompatible donor kidney.

          -  Has a positive T- or B-cell cross-match by NIH anti-globulin lymphocytotoxicity method
             or CDC crossmatch method, if performed.

          -  Has a positive T- or B-cell flow cross-match AND donor specific anti-HLA antibody
             (DSA) detected by flow cytometry, Luminex® based antigen-specific anti-HLA antibody
             testing, or by similar methodology, if performed.

          -  Has undergone desensitization to remove donor specific anti-HLA antibodies prior to
             transplantation.

          -  Has participated in an investigational study within the last 30 days or received an
             investigational product within 5 half-lives of the study drug administration,
             whichever is longest.

          -  Has known allergy to or has participated in a prior study with siRNA.

          -  Has a history of HBV (Note: subjects with a serological profile suggestive of
             clearance, or prior antiviral treatment of a prior HBV infection, may be enrolled with
             the approval of the Medical Monitor).

          -  Has a history of HIV.

          -  Recipient of a known HIV positive donor kidney.

          -  Is HCV-positive (detectable HCV RNA) (Note: Subjects at least 24 weeks from completion
             of treatment with an approved antiviral regimen and who remain free of HCV as
             determined by HCV RNA testing may be enrolled. Subjects who have been cleared of HCV
             virus after treatment with an unapproved regimen should be approved by the Medical
             Monitor).</exclusivecriteria>
