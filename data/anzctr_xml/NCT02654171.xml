  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - AK0529
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: AK0529 - Subjects will receive single or multiple doses of AK0529 at different dose levels within different cohorts.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Patients who are randomized to the control arm within each cohort will receive the corresponding placebo to AK0529.


Treatment: drugs: AK0529
AK0529 is a novel compound being developed for the treatment of RSV infection. The enteric coated drug pellets with sugar core can be administered orally with apple sauce/purée or yoghurt, or by flushing with 10% dextrose water via a nasogastric or other feeding tube, or upon a glucose wafer.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
The placebo was made with the same smell and appearance as AK0529 but without the active ingredients. The placebo supplements are composed primarily of microcrystaline cellulose pellet.

             prematurity of =1 month and =24 months.

          -  Diagnosis of RSV infection by virological means, which may include rapid diagnostic
             point-of-care testing, within 96 hours preceding screening for Part 1 and 72 hours for
             Part 2.

             disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, glycogen storage disorders).

          -  Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g. congenital agammaglobulinaemia, common
             variable immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy other than glucocorticoid or
             montelukast therapy forming part of care directed by the treating physician).

          -  For Part 2 of this study, children with a history of having received palivizumab or
             any other monoclonal agent directed against RSV in the preceding 120 days. This
             exclusion criterion does not apply to Part 1.

          -  Evidence of active or uncontrolled respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, central nervous
             system or renal disease unrelated to RSV infection at baseline or any other medical
             condition that in the opinion of the investigator renders the patient unsuitable for
             enrolment.

          -  A history of epilepsy or seizures including febrile seizures.

          -  Allergy to test medication or constituents.

             investigator or the study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or
             other studies under the direction of that investigator of the study center, or any
