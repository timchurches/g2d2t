  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) is a unique system of parenting and family support, developed through over 30 years of research, that aims to provide parents with a range of strategies to promote parental confidence, skills and knowledge, reducing the risk of behavioural, emotional and developmental problems in children. 
Group Triple-P has been chosen as the intervention to be used in this study because it has been previously evaluated and shows good efficacy. Involves active skills training to teach parents these key parenting strategies, including videotaped modelling of skills, roleplay, rehearsal and feedback. Group Triple P consists of four group sessions of 2 hours each and focus on the following topics: positive parenting, helping children develop, managing misbehaviour and planning ahead for high risk situations. For the purpose of this research the four sessions will be separated in two days: Day one  session 1 and session 2 and (after a week) Day two- session 3 and 4, in each day will be offered a coffee break between the sessions. Upon completion of the group sessions, parents will participate in three individual telephone consultations to assist parents to implement the skills learnt in the program, which will last 15-30 minutes each for two consecutive weeks, with one consultation every five days. After the telephone consultations, parents will return for a final 2 hours group session to summarize program content and discuss how to proceed after the program.
The group sessions will be audio-recorded for the purpose of ensuring that the intervention is implemented according to the research protocol.
Before the first group session, a workbook summarising the content of every session and suggested homework will be given to each parent. The program will be delivered in Portuguese and conducted by a trained psychologist (registered in Brazil) and accredited Triple P Practitioner. Moreover, in order to reduce common barriers to attendance, the program will be offered free of charge and, at each session, participants and their children will receive a free meal and free childcare.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be a wait-list control. Parents in the waitlist control group will be assessed at the same time as the intervention group, and for ethical reasons, will receive a Triple P intervention after the study has been completed and all data has been collected.</comparator>

    <concealment>Parents who express an interest in the study (either by emailing the researchers or calling) will be asked to complete a telephone screening interview designed to assess the family’s suitability for the program as well as to ensure that the families meet the following criteria.
Parents of families who met the inclusion criteria will be asked to read the information sheet and to sign the consent form. Randomization to conditions will be conducted after the participant's completion of pre-intervention measures.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Eligible families will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups, an intervention or waitlist control group. Randomization will be implemented using a list of computer generated random numbers, and families will be assigned sequentially to condition according to the list using a series of pre-labelled, sealed opaque envelopes,  administered by a research assistant, to ensure that the first researcher is blind to group assignment.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>To analyse the intervention effects following program completion, and at 6-months follow up, we will use Structural Equation Model (SEM), further, multigroup analyses will be used to compare the outcomes between the Intervention and Control groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of the Positive Parenting Program (Group Triple P) and cultural acceptability with Brazilian parents. Secondary analyses will also be conducted to examine if parental attributions change during the intervention and if attributions mediate the relationship between intervention exposure and outcomes. This study can offer unique contribution to understand the efficacy of a parenting program in a developing country such as Brazil. Collecting information directly from parents can also provide valuable insights to help researchers and family service to consider tailoring or developing a parenting program appropriated and relevant for Brazilian families. In addition, the results of this study may shed light on the processes underlying the effects in parenting programs.</summary>
