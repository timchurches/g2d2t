Patients randomized to TPC will receive single-agent IV chemotherapy, limited to choice of one of the following 7 agents: eribulin, ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or nab-paclitaxel.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) of Patients - To compare Overall Survival (OS) of patients who receive 145 mg/m2 NKTR-102 given once every 21 days (q21d) with OS of patients who receive Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC). Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Patients will be followed until their date of death or until final database closure. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up or are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive or at the date of event cut-off for OS analysis.</outcome>
