  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Confirmed Morbidity or Mortality Event up to the End of Treatment (Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Patients Without a Morbidity or Mortality Event) - Morbidity or mortality events were defined as: a) Death; b) Atrial septostomy; c) Lung transplantation; d) Initiation of intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous prostanoids, or; e) Other worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Other worsening of PAH was defined by the combined occurrence of all the following 3 events:
At least 15% decrease in the 6 minute walk distance from baseline, confirmed by 2 tests performed on separate days, within 2 weeks.
AND worsening of PAH symptoms including at least one of the following:
a) Increase in WHO Functional Class (WHO FC), or no change in patients in WHO FC IV at baseline; b) Appearance or worsening of signs of right heart failure that did not respond to optimized oral diuretic therapy
AND need for new treatment(s) for PAH that included the following: a) Oral or inhaled prostanoids; b) Oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors; c) Endothelin receptor antagonists (only after discontinuation of study treatment; d) i.v. diuretics</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Death Due to PAH or Hospitalisation for PAH up to the End of Treatment (Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Patients Without an Event) - Events of PAH or hospitalization for PAH up to the end of treatment included: death due to PAH, or onset of a treatment-emergent adverse event with a fatal outcome due to PAH occurring up to 4 weeks after the end of treatment, or hospitalisation for PAH up to the end of treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to end of treatment (data presented up to month 36)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Death Due to Any Cause up to the End of Treatment (Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Patients Without an Event) - Events of death due to any cause up to the end of treatment (plus 7 days)</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Death Due to Any Cause up to the End of Study (Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Patients Without an Event) - Events of death due to any cause up to the end of study (EOS). The initiation of EOS procedure occurred when the target of 285 events was expected to have been achieved (30 January 2012).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to end of study (data presented up to month 36)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 6 in 6-minute Walk Distance - The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a non-encouraged test, performed in a 30 m long flat corridor, where the patient is instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed. These guidelines were provided to all sites. For patients who had never performed a 6MWT previously, a training test was required before the qualifying tests for inclusion were performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to month 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Patients With Improvements in World Health Organization Functional Class From Baseline to Month 6 - Class I: no limitation of usual physical activity (PA) which does not increase dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, or presyncope.
Class II: mild limitation of PA. No discomfort at rest. Normal PA increases dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, or presyncope.
Class III: marked limitation of PA. No discomfort at rest. Less than ordinary activity increases dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, or presyncope.
Class IV: unable to perform any PA and who may have signs of right ventricular failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may be present at rest and symptoms are increased by almost any PA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to month 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulmonary Vascular Resistance at Baseline and Month 6 - In a sub-study, hemodynamic variables were assessed at baseline and Month 6. If the patient had undergone a right heart catheterization during the 3 months prior to randomization, these results were to be used as baseline values, if the background therapy had not changed during the intervening period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to month 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac Index at Baseline and Month 6 - In a sub-study, hemodynamic variables were assessed at baseline and Month 6. If the patient had undergone a right heart catheterization during the 3 months prior to randomization, these results were to be used as baseline values, if the background therapy had not changed during the intervening period.</outcome>

    <summary>The AC-055-302/SERAPHIN study will be an event-driven Phase III study, comparing two
      different doses of macitentan (ACT-064992) (3 and 10 mg) vs placebo in patients with
      symptomatic PAH. The main study objective is to demonstrate that macitentan (ACT-064992)
      prolongs time to the first morbidity or mortality event, and to evaluate the benefit/risk
      profile of macitentan (ACT-064992) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic PAH.</summary>
