  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise: progressive supervised aerobic (e.g. walking and cycling) and resistance exercises (e.g. upper and lower body resistance based exercise using weight machines) twice weekly (60 minute sessions) for 6 months. The training will be supplemented with a printed booklet containing general information about physical activity.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: 6 month usual care group. All participants in this group will be provided with a printed booklet with general information about physical activity.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aerobic capacity will be measured by subjects completing a timed 400 meters corridor walking test, which consisted of 10 laps out and back over a 20-meter course, as fast as they can at a pace they can maintain over the distance. The 400 meters walk has been shown to be a valid test to estimate aerobic capacity and walking endurance in older adults.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of intervention post-test (6 months), and at 6 months after the end of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood metabolic biomarkers: insulin, lipid profile, glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin  levels will be measured commercially by accredited Australian National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) and International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) laboratories.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of intervention post-test (6 months), and at 6 months after the end of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Abdominal obesity: central adiposity will be assessed by waist circumference and hip circumference will also be determined using anthropometric measures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of intervention post-test (6 months), and at 6 months after the end of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated using the measurements of height and weight.

Additionally body composition (lean and fat mass) derived from Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) whole body scan will be measured for the participants in the Western Australia (Perth) cohort.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of intervention post-test (6 months), and at 6 months after the end of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Balance and risk of falling will be determined using the activities-specific balance scale. 

Additionally, participants from Western Australia (Perth) cohort will be tested on the Neurocom Smart Balancemaster system to measure static and dynamic balance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of intervention post-test (6 months), and at 6 months after the end of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lower body physical function will be tested using a repeated chair rise test.

Additionally, the participants in the Western Australia (Perth) cohort will be tested for maximum muscle strength using the one repitition maximum (1-RM) method. 1-RM will be assessed for leg-press, chest press. seated row and leg extension.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, end of intervention post-test (6 months), and at 6 months after the end of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life and psychological distress will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Prostate Specific Module (EORTC QLQ-PR25), Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36v2), and The Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks if supervised physical exercise is useful in reducing side effects of hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have been enrolled in the Randomised Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy (RADAR) study. 

Trial details: 
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will undertake supervised resistance and aerobic exercise. Sessions are 60 minutes each, twice weekly over 6 months. The other group will be provided with a printed booklet with general information about physical exercise. The study will measure aerobic capacity, abdominal obesity, lipid and glycemic control, muscle function and other indicators of well-being before, immediately after the program and 6 months after the program. The use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is accompanied by a number of side effects. This study will investigate the effects of supervised physical exercise on reversing ADT related side effects.</summary>
