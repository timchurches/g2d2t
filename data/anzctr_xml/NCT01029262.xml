    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Lenalidomide
Other interventions - Placebo

Experimental: Arm #1 - Lenalidomide plus placebo - Lenalidomide 10 mg by mouth (PO) daily plus 2 placebo capsules for participants with a creatinine clearance = 60 mL/min for at least 168 days until disease progression, intolerable side effects or withdrawal of consent. Lenalidomide 5 mg PO daily plus 2 placebo capsules for participants with a creatinine clearance = 40 and &lt; 60 mL/min.

Placebo Comparator: Arm #2 - placebo - Three placebo capsules once daily for at least 168 days until disease progression occurred, intolerable side effects or withdrawal of consent.


Treatment: drugs: Lenalidomide
One 10 mg Lenalidomide capsule + 2 placebo capsules or (3 placebo capsules) once daily for subjects with a creatinine clearance = 60 mL/min. Alternatively-one 5 mg Lenalidomide capsule + 2 placebo capsules (or 3 placebo capsules) once daily for subjects with a creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL/min. Subjects may take study drug for at least 168 days unless there are intolerable side effects or disease progresses. Subjects may continue study drug beyond 168 days if they have an erythroid response (increase in their hemoglobin levels and fewer transfusions administered than before starting study drug)

The double-blind treatment phase was defined as the period between the 1st dosing up until 28 days after the last study drug dose</outcome>

      <outcome>Kaplan Meier Estimates of Duration of 56-day RBC TI Response as Determined by the Sponsor - The duration of the first 56-day RBC transfusion-independence response was calculated for those who achieved a response and was dependent on whether a subsequent RBC transfusion was given after the transfusion-free period (response):
for those who received a subsequent RBC transfusion after the response starts, the duration of response was not censored, and was calculated as response duration = last day of response - first day of response +1 where the last day of response was defined as 1 day before the first RBC transfusion which was given at 56 days or more after the response starts.
for those who did not receive a subsequent RBC transfusion after the response started, the end day of the response was censored and duration of the response was calculated as response duration = date of last RBC transfusion assessment - first day of response+ 1. A responder was a participant who had a = 56 consecutive days of RBC-transfusion-free period after the first study drug treatment period</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Erythroid Response Based on Modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 Criteria - A participant was considered as having achieved an erythroid response if the participant either:
- had a hemoglobin (Hgb) increase =1.5 g/dL compared to baseline and confirmed by another central laboratory hemoglobin value at 4 to 8 weeks after the first Hgb measurement that also increased =1.5 g/dL. All Hgb values during this time interval must have had a = 1.5 g/dL increase (ie, no central laboratory Hgb increase during this timeframe could be less &lt;1.5 g/dL). The duration of Hgb increase is from the date of a first =1.5 g/dL increase to the last date when Hgb value still have a =1.5 g/dL increase.
OR
- had a 50% reduction in the number of the RBC transfusion units over any consecutive 56 days period compared to the baseline transfusion burden.
The baseline transfusion burden is the number of units over 112 days by the randomization divided by 2. Only transfusions given for a pre-transfusion Hgb value of 9 g/dL or less may be used in this response assessment.</outcome>

The day from the first dose of study drug to the date at which RBC-transfusion-independence starts was achieved and calculated using: Start date of the first response period - the date of the first study drug +1. A responder was defined as a participant who had a = 56 consecutive days of RBC-transfusion-free period after the first dose of study drug in the treatment phase.</outcome>

The participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last known day when participants did not have AML. Participants who did not progress to AML at the last follow-up contact were censored at the day of the last follow-up contact.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) - A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;
Life-threatening event;
Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event
The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 3.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death.</outcome>

      <outcome>Compliance Rates Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) From Baseline to Week 48 - The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher score on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. A participant was considered compliant at a visit if at least 15 out of the QLQ-C30 items in the questionnaire were checked.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lenalidomide would reduce the number of
      red blood cell transfusions (RBC) needed in anemic (RBC transfusion-dependent) participants
      with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS without a deletion 5q chromosome abnormality. The study
      also investigated the safety of lenalidomide use in these participants. Two-thirds of the
      participants received oral lenalidomide and one-third of the participants received oral
      placebo.</summary>
