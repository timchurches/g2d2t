  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - BAF312
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: BAF312 - 1090 patients will be randomized to receive BAF312 during the trial for a maximum of approximately 3 years (Core Part). Patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be treated with BAF312 daily. Following the Core Part, eligible patients enter the Extension Part during which all receive open-label BAF312 for a maximum of 84 additional months.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Matching Placebo administered orally during the Core Part of the trial. Following the Core Part, eligible patients enter the Extension Part during which all receive open-label BAF312 for a maximum of 84 additional months.


Treatment: drugs: BAF312
Patients will be randomized to receive BAF312. BAF312 will be provided in a dose titration from 0.25 mg to a 2 mg dose.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
