    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (Glycosylated Hemoglobin) (HbA1c) at Week 12 - The blood samples were collected at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and at Week 12 (or early withdrawal). Baseline was defined as the period immediately preceding treatment with study medication (Week 0). For participants with missing Baseline assessment, the last pre-therapy value prior to the Baseline visit was used as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was the value at Week 12 minus Baseline value. The primary analysis was performed on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population with Last observation carried forward (LOCF). Adjusted mean is presented as least square (LS) mean.</outcome>
