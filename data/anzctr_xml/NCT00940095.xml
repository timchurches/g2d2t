    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria :

          1. Males and females aged 18 to 75 years (inclusive).

          2. Patients with a ruptured saccular aneurysm, confirmed by angiography (digital
             subtraction angiography [DSA] or computed tomography angiography [CTA], investigator's
             assessment), and which has been successfully* secured by endovascular coiling. The
             time of aneurysm rupture must be known or possible to estimate with a reasonable
             degree of certainty.

          3. World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade I-IV measured prior to the
             endovascular coiling procedure, and which does not worsen to grade V post-procedure
             (based on regular Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS])(1)

          4. Patients with any thick clot (short axis &lt; 4 mm) on baseline CT scan (investigator's
             assessment).

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and must use
             a reliable method of contraception during the 12 weeks following study drug
             discontinuation.

          6. Written informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from the patient
             or a legal representative prior to initiation of any study-mandated procedure and
             randomization.

               -  A successful procedure is defined as a procedure after which the end of procedure
                  DSA indicates that the coiling was complete or adequate (i.e., more than 50% of
                  the volume of the aneurysm is filled in by coiling material, investigator's
                  assessment) and when the patient is not scheduled for a 2nd procedure on the
                  ruptured aneurysm within 12 weeks post-aSAH.

                    1. Patients must be evaluable for WFNS grade prior to the endovascular coiling
                       procedure. Patients who cannot be assessed for WFNS post procedure due to a
                       requirement for uninterrupted sedation (e.g., for high or unstable
                       intracranial pressure [ICP]) may be included in the study provided that a CT
                       scan is performed at least 12 hours post-procedure, but prior to
                       randomization, ruling out any large procedure-related infarct.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion Criteria :

          1. subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to causes other than saccular aneurysm.

          2. giant aneurysms (height or width &gt; or = 25 mm).

          3. intraventricular or intracerebral blood, in absence of subarachnoid blood, or clot is
             only thin (short axis &lt; 4 mm).

          4. cerebral vasospasm on angiography (investigator's assessment) prior to endovascular
             coiling (intraprocedural cerebral vasospasm is not an exclusion criterion).

          5. a major complication during the endovascular coiling procedure, such as massive
             intracranial bleeding, intracranial thromboembolism, coil migration, aneurysm
             perforation or rupture, arterial dissection, major arterial occlusion, a large
             territorial cerebral infarct defined as involving &gt; 1/3 of a vascular territory, or a
             new major neurological deficit post-procedure (e.g., hemiplegia or aphasia lasting &gt;
             or = 12 hours post-aneurysm coiling)*.

          6. current ruptured aneurysm previously secured (successfully or not) by clipping.

          7. coiling material used, which has not been approved by local health authorities.

          8. use of liquid embolism aneurysmal treatment or flow diverting device.

          9. several aneurysms among which the ruptured one cannot be identified with certainty and
             which are not all secured during the coiling procedure.

         10. no end-of-procedure DSA.

         11. another securing procedure planned for any aneurysm between randomization and Week 12
             post-aSAH.

         12. study drug start &gt;56 hours after the aneurysm rupture.

         13. known, at time of screening, that certain follow-up, or protocol-mandated imaging
             assessments will not be feasible.

         14. hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; or = 90 mmHg) refractory to treatment.

         15. aspiration pneumonia.

         16. pulmonary edema or severe cardiac failure requiring inotropic support at time of
             randomization.

         17. any severe or unstable concomitant condition or disease (e.g., known significant
             neurological deficit, cancer, hematological, coronary disease, psychiatric disorder),
             which would affect assessment of the safety or efficacy of the study drug
             (investigator's opinion).

         18. significant kidney disease defined by plasma creatinine &gt; or = 2.5 mg/dL (221
             micromol/l) and/or liver disease defined by total bilirubin &gt; 2-fold Upper Limit of
             Normal as measured at local laboratory, and/or known diagnosis or clinical suspicion
             of liver cirrhosis.

         19. infusion of i.v. nimodipine or i.v. nicardipine must have these drugs discontinued at
             least 4 hours prior to initiation of study treatment.

         20. infusion of i.v. fasudil within 24-hour period preceding planned start of study drug
             initiation.

         21. start of statins less than 2 weeks prior to admission must have them discontinued
             prior to study drug initiation.

         22. infusion of cyclosporin A or other calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus), or
             patients for whom it is known at the time of randomization that these medications will
             be started during the study drug infusion period.

         23. intake of an investigational product including investigational coil material within 28
             days prior to randomization or those who have already participated in current study or
             CONSCIOUS-2 (AC-054-301).

         24. unlikely event to comply with protocol (e.g., unable to return for follow-up visits).

         25. known hypersensitivity to other endothelin receptor antagonists.26.current alcohol or
             drug abuse/dependence.

               -  "Large territorial infarct" refers to infarcts detected during the endovascular
                  coiling procedure or immediately post-procedure (i.e., CT performed for suspicion
                  of cerebral infarct or other complication). This does not imply having to wait
                  24-48 hours post-procedure to perform the protocol-mandated CT scan in order to
                  randomize a patient. Evaluation for a new major neurological deficit
                  post-procedure implies reversal of sedation and performance of a GCS examination
                  (verbal scores in intubated patients may be extrapolated from the eye-opening and
                  motor scores using predefined values). If a new major neurological deficit does
                  not improve within 12 hours after the coiling procedure, the patient cannot be
                  included.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to demonstrate that clazosentan, administered as a continuous
      intravenous infusion at either 5 mg/h or 15 mg/h until Day 14 post aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (aSAH), reduces the incidence of cerebral vasospasm-related morbidity and
      all-cause mortality within 6 weeks post-aSAH treated by endovascular coiling.

      The primary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm-related morbidity,
      and mortality of all-causes within 6 weeks post-aSAH, defined by at least one of the
      following:

        1. Death (all causes).

        2. New cerebral infarct(s) due to cerebral vasospasm as either the primary or relevant
           contributing cause, or not adjudicated to be entirely due to causes other than
           vasospasm.

        3. Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) due to cerebral vasospasm as either the
           primary or relevant contributing cause, or not adjudicated to be entirely due to causes
           other than vasospasm.

        4. Administration of a valid rescue therapy in the presence of confirmed cerebral vasospasm
           on angiography (DSA or CTA).

      An independent Critical Events Committee (CEC) will adjudicate whether or not patients meet
      the primary endpoint and its individual morbidity components.</summary>
