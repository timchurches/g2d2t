  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Change of Adjusted Lung Density - As measured by centralized, standardized computer tomographic (CT) lung densitometry. CT scans were acquired at 2 inspiration states: TLC (Total Lung Capacity; ie, full inspiration) and FRC (Functional Residual Capacity; ie, full expiration). Results were adjusted for total lung volume and are presented as point estimates for the average rate of decline in the early start and delayed start subgroups from a linear random regression model with country, inspiration state (only for 'TLC and FRC state'), time (time elapsed since Day 1 [CE1226_4001]), treatment and treatment by time interaction as fixed effects and subject and subject by time interaction as random coefficients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change in Adjusted Lung Density - Absolute change from baseline to 2 years as measured by centralized, standardized CT lung densitometry. CT scans were acquired at 2 inspiration states: TLC (ie, full inspiration) and FRC (ie, full expiration). Results were adjusted for total lung volume and are presented as point estimates for the average absolute change in the early start and delayed start subgroups from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with country, treatment, and baseline lung density as fixed effects and inspiration state as a repeated random effect. The baseline is the last assessment from the preceding study CE1226_4001.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change in Adjusted Lung Density - Percent change from baseline to 2 years as measured by centralized, standardized CT lung densitometry. CT scans were acquired at 2 inspiration states: TLC (ie, full inspiration) and FRC (ie, full expiration). Results were adjusted for total lung volume and are presented as point estimates for the average percent change in the early start and delayed start subgroups from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with country, treatment, and baseline lung density as fixed effects and inspiration state as a repeated random effect. The baseline is the last assessment from the preceding study CE1226_4001.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Subject-reported Symptoms - Patient-reported symptoms were measured using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). SGRQ total, symptoms, activity and impact scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations, and change from baseline below zero (0) is favorable, indicating improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change in Lung Function as Measured by Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</outcome>

    <summary>This study is a continuation of the placebo-controlled study CE1226_4001 (NCT00261833) to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zemaira® intravenous (i.v). administration in subjects
      with emphysema due to alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. The long-term verification of a
      disease-modifying benefit of Zemaira® on the progression of emphysema will be assessed by
      volume-adjusted lung density, measured yearly by computed tomography (CT).</summary>
