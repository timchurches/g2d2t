  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Rituximab
Treatment: drugs - Azathioprine

Experimental: Rituximab Maintenance - Rituximab maintenance: 1g at 4, 8, 12, 16 &amp; 20 months with standardised steroid taper

Active Comparator: Azathioprine Maintenance - Azathioprine Maintenance: 2mg/kg/day with standardised steroid taper, from month 4 (randomisation) (200 mg maximum daily dose). Azathioprine withdrawn at month 27.


Other interventions: Rituximab
Rituximab IV infusion 1000 mg x 1 dose at months 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 and glucocorticoids. Four - six hour infusion. Treatment with rituximab will cease at month 20.

Treatment: drugs: Azathioprine
Oral dosage form. Target dose is 2mg/kg; maximum daily dose is 200mg. This should be continued until month 24. The dose should then by reduced by 50% and azathioprine completely withdrawn at month 27.
The dose should be rounded down to the nearest 25mg. The dose may vary on alternate days e.g. 100mg one day, 150mg the next for patients on an overall dose of 125mg daily.
If patients are aged over 60 years, reduce the dose by 25%. If patients are aged over 75 years, reduce the dose by 50%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rituximab is now established as an effective drug for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
      (ANCA) vasculitis following major European and US trials reported in 2010. After a time, its
      effect wears off and the disease can return. This occurs in at least half of patients within
      2 years of receiving Rituximab. A preliminary study in Cambridge has suggested that repeating
      rituximab every six months stops the disease returning and is safe.

      The RITAZAREM trial will find out whether repeating rituximab stops vasculitis returning and
      whether it works better than the older treatments, azathioprine or methotrexate. It will also
      tell us how long patients remain well after the repeated rituximab treatments are stopped,
      and if repeated rituximab is safe. We should also learn useful information about the effects
      of rituximab on quality of life and economic measures. The trial results will help decide the
      best treatment for future patients who have their vasculitis initially treated with
      rituximab.

      RITAZAREM aims to recruit patients with established ANCA vasculitis whose disease has come
      back 'relapsing vasculitis'. All patients will be treated with rituximab and steroids and we
      anticipate that most will respond well. If their disease is under reasonable control after
      four months, further treatment with either rituximab (a single dose ever four months for two
      years) or azathioprine tablets will be chosen randomly. The patients in the rituximab and
      azathioprine groups will then be compared. Patients will be in the trial for four years.

      The study has been designed by members of the European Vasculitis Study group (EUVAS) and the
      Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC). It will include 190 participants from 30
      hospitals in Europe, the USA, Australia and Mexico.

      RITAZAREM is being funded by Arthritis Research UK, the U.S. National Institutes of Health
      and by Roche/Genentech.</summary>
