    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tofacitinib
Treatment: drugs - Tofacitinib

Experimental: Tofacitinib - All patients will be in tofacitinib treatment group.


Treatment: drugs: Tofacitinib
Tofacitinib will be administered orally BID (twice daily) approximately 12 hours (±2 hours) apart, once in the morning and once in the evening, based on body weight.
Body Weight (Dose in tablet [mg BID] or solution [ml BID]) 5 - &lt; 7 kg (2 mg or 2 ml) 7 - &lt; 10 kg (2.5 mg or 2.5 ml) 10 - &lt;15 kg (3 mg or 3 ml) 15 - &lt;25 kg (3.5 mg or 3.5 ml) 25 - &lt;40 kg (4 mg or 4 ml) &gt;=40 kg (5 mg or 5 ml)
Oral solution (1 mg/mL concentration) will be used for subjects weighing &lt;40 kg. Oral tablets (5 mg) will be used for subjects weighing &gt;=40 kg; subjects who are unable to swallow tablets will have the option of taking oral solution.
Subjects will swallow study tablets whole and will not manipulate or chew tablets prior to swallowing.

Treatment: drugs: Tofacitinib
For subjects rolling over from study A3921103 and actively participating in this study at the time of Protocol Amendment 6 and receiving a dosage of tofacitinib in accordance with the dosing scheme specified in Protocol Amendment 5, investigators will have the option of maintaining the subject's current dosage regimen from index study A3921103 (if the desired clinical response has been attained with no safety concern) or adjusting the dosage regimen in accordance with the dosing scheme specified in this section.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Pediatric subjects with JIA aged from 2 to less than 18 years who met entry criteria
             for the qualifying/index study and in the opinion of the investigator have sufficient
             evidence of JIA disease activity to warrant use of tofacitinib as a DMARD. Subjects
             turning 18 years of age during participation in the qualifying/index study or
             subsequently will be eligible for participation in this study.

          -  The subject has discontinued disallowed concomitant medications for the required time
             prior to the first dose of study drug, as defined in Appendix 1, and is taking only
             those concomitant medications in doses and frequency allowed by the protocol.

          -  Fertile male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who are, in the

             this protocol throughout the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of
             study medication.

          -  Subjects must have previously completed participation in a qualifying study of
             tofacitinib for the treatment of JIA. Subjects who have required earlier
             discontinuation of treatment in a qualifying study for reasons other than tofacitinib
             related serious adverse events may be eligible.</inclusivecriteria>

               1. Chronic infections.

               2. Any infection requiring hospitalization, parenteral antimicrobial therapy or
                  judged to be opportunistic by the investigator within the 6 months prior to the
                  first dose of study drug.

               3. Any treated infections within 2 weeks of baseline visit.

               4. A subject known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis
                  B or hepatitis C virus.

               5. History of infected joint prosthesis with prosthesis still in situ.

          -  History of recurrent (more than one episode) herpes zoster or disseminated (a single
             episode) herpes zoster or disseminated (a single episode) herpes simplex.</exclusivecriteria>
