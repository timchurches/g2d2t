    <interventions>All patient receive induction chemotherapy- six cycles of VIDE (Jurgens, 2006). Disease assessment will be performed prior to treatment and after the 2nd (latest 3rd) and 5th (latest 6th) cycle of VIDE chemotherapy.The decision regarding local therapy must be made following the fifth cycle of of induction treatment, with preference for surgical intervention with or without additional radiotherapy.Depending on the presentation at the time of diagnosis and on the histological response to induction chemotherapy, patients will be stratified into to the following risk groups: 
Standard Risk R1: (1) Patients with localised disease and good histological response at surgery after induction chemotherapy and (2) Patients with initial surgery or in whom surgery was not feasible and who have small tumours &lt; 200 mL at diagnosis.
High Risk localised disease R2loc*: (1) Patients with localised disease and poor histological response at surgery after induction chemotherapy and (2) Patients with initial surgery or in whom surgery was not feasible and who have large tumours &gt; 200 mL at diagnosis.High Risk primary lung metastases R2pulm*: Patients with a Ewing sarcoma metastatic to the lungs and/or pleura, but not to any other sites, at the time of diagnosis.
Very High Risk R3: Patients with metastatic disease not confined to the lungs and/or pleura, i.e. patients with bone metastases, bone marrow metastases or other metastases (e.g. lymph nodes, liver, CNS, etc) with and without additional pulmonary metastases at the time of diagnosis.

Good responders (R1) will receive an additional eight cycles of chemotherapy VAC (Female) or VAI (Male). They will be randomised to receive add-on treatment with zoledronic acid, or no add-on treatment. High Risk R2 *Poor responders (R2) with localised disease (R2loc) and primary pulmonary metastases (R2pulm)  will continue to be randomised as in EURO-E.W.I.N.G. 99 to receive either eight cycles of VAI chemotherapy or high dose treatment with busulfan-melphalan. Very High Risk (R3) patients receive six cycles of VIDE induction chemotherapy and are then randomised to either continue with eight cycles of VAC chemotherapy or high dose treosulfan-melphalan (TreoMel) chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell reinfusion, followed thereafter by eight cycles of VAC chemotherapy.

Value of PET / PET-CT
PET analyses will be performed at initial diagnosis and after the 2nd (or 3rd)) and 5th (or 6th) cycle of VIDE. The value for diagnosis and response evaluation will be assessed in comparison with standard imaging procedures such as MRI, CT scan, 99TC scintigraphy. For response evaluation, histological response will serve as an additional parameter to be compared. As FDG-PET and PET-CT may not be available in all participating institutions, PET is not mandatory and the lack of a PET investigation does not violate any of the basic codes of practice defined within the treatment protocol.</outcome>

QoL will be assessed in R1 and R3 patients four times during protocol treatment:

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Impact of the time to diagnosis on presentation and outcome is a composite secondary outcome : To investigate the impact of the time to diagnosis on the presentation and outcome of the patients. The impact of the time to diagnosis will be assessed by review of medical records and MRI/PET scans results when the last patient enrolled in the study has finished treatment.

Due to the inconspicuousness of the early warning signs the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma is often delayed. As yet, the average time of delay and the putative consequences of a delayed diagnosis have not been investigated. Therefore, we aim to investigate the impact of the time to diagnosis on presentation of disease and outcome.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Survival anaylsis: All patients randomised in the trial will be included in the intent-to-treat analysis in their allocated treatment group. For certain questions additional 'per protocol' analysis are intended. No patient will be excluded from analysis once he or she is entered into the study, unless informed consent is withdrawn. Event-free survival and overall survival will be estimated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier (1958(.
Comparison between randomised arms and analysis of prognostic factors: Comparisions are performed by logrank tests. Variables are univariately analysed regarding impact on EFS by logrank test or chi-square analysis as appropriate. Multivariate analyses of variables with regard to EFS times are performed by Cox analysis (1972). Analyses of specific failure risks are performed by means of competing risk analysis (1995). Those patients who are included in the study but cannot be randomised will be included in exploratory analyses for EFS and OS outcomes.

****NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 633 (R1+R3) plus patients recruited in R2loc and R2pulm by the predetermined end of recruitment


****Sample Size****

All power calculations in R1 and R3 were based on 3-year EFS rates performing a twosided (except R3: one side-hypothesis) adaptive logrank test with alpha=0.05 (except R3: alpha=0.025) and power=0.80. For all risk groups R1, R2loc,R2pulm and R3 three interim analyses are intended to be performed using an inverse normal design corresponding to an equally spaced four step group sequential design according to OBrien &amp; Fleming (Wassmer 2006, OBrien &amp; Fleming 1979). After each interim analysis a data dependent sample size calculation may be performed. Then, the accrual period, the observation time and the schedule of the next interim and final analysis (required number of events) can be adapted. If no adaptions are performed, the inverse normal design coincides with the underlying group sequential design. The Schoenfeld formula was used to compute the necessary number of events (Schoenfeld, 1981). Sample size calculations were computed with Addplan Software V. 3.1.3 and ADDPLAN V. 6.0 (Wassmer, 2006).</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>What is this project about?	
EWING 2008 is a joint protocol of European and North American Ewing sarcoma study groups. The protocol is aimed at optimising treatment and treatment results of patients with Ewing sarcomas. 
Who is it for?
The EWING 2008 protocol is open to all patients aged 4-49 years, diagnosed with Ewing sarcomas of bone or soft tissue, localised or metastatic, who are considered eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Study details
All patients registered will receive induction chemotherapy consisting of six cycles of vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide (VIDE). The decision regarding local therapy must be made following the fifth cycle of induction treatment, with a preference for surgical intervention with or without additional radiotherapy. Standard Risk R1 Good responders (R1) (&lt; 10% viable tumour cells) with localised disease are allocated to the standard risk arm and will receive a further eight cycles of chemotherapy composed of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) (females) or ifosfamide instead of cyclophosphamide (VAI) (males). They will be randomised to receive add-on treatment with zoledronic acid, or no add-on treatment.  Very High Risk R3 Patients with disseminated disease, i.e. dissemination to bone and/or other sites and possibly additional pulmonary dissemination (R3), receive six cycles of VIDE induction chemotherapy. Patients are then randomised to either continue with eight cycles of vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide (VAC) chemotherapy or high dose treosulfan-melphalan (TreoMel) chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell reinfusion followed thereafter by eight cycles of VAC chemotherapy. Local therapy in R3 patients is following VIDE induction, whenever feasible prior to high dose therapy (HDT).
It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information of the efficacy and toxicity of each of the chemotherapy treatment protocols for patients newly diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma.
