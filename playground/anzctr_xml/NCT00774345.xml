It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was present prior to study treatment and that remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is safe and effective
      as a maintenance therapy at improving further the quality of the response you achieved with
      your last therapy and at prolonging the duration of your response. This study will compare
      the effects (good and bad) of lenalidomide with the dummy drug.</summary>
