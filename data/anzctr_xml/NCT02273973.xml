  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate the
      effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 (also known as taselisib) versus letrozole and
      placebo in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer. Participants will be
      randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization ratio. Letrozole at
      2.5 milligrams (mg) will be dosed once daily plus either Taselisib at 4 mg (two 2-mg tablets)
      or placebo on a 5 days-on/ 2 days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks.</summary>
