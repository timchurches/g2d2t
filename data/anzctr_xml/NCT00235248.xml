                  endarterectomy)

          -  CT scan with an intracranial lesion other than brain infarction (space occupying mass,
             intracranial hemorrhage)

          -  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with plaque = 4 mm in thickness distal to the
             supposed embolized artery (judgement of the investigator).

          -  Contraindication to clopidogrel, aspirin, and oral anticoagulants</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ARCH is a controlled trial with a sequential design and with a prospective, randomized,
      open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) methodology. The objective is to compare the efficacy
      and tolerance (net benefit) of two antithrombotic strategies in patients with
      atherothrombosis of the aortic arch and a recent (less than 6 months) cerebral or peripheral
      embolic event.

      Hypothesis:

      The association of clopidogrel 75 mg/d plus aspirin 75 mg/d is 25% more effective than an
      oral anticoagulant (target International Normalized Ratio [INR] 2 to 3) in preventing brain
      infarction, brain hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, peripheral embolism, and vascular death.</summary>
