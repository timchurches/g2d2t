  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - alemtuzumab

Experimental: Previously treated with alemtuzumab - Alemtuzumab 12 mg per day administered through IV, once a day for 3 consecutive days (participants might receive additional cycles of alemtuzumab upon documented evidence of resumed disease activity, but not within same 12-month period)

Experimental: Previously treated with interferon beta-1a (Rebif®) - Alemtuzumab 12 mg per day administered through IV, once a day for 5 consecutive days during the first cycle and 12 mg per day administered through IV, once a day for 3 consecutive days during the second cycle, 12 months later. Participants might qualify for as-needed retreatment (12 mg per day administered through IV, once a day for 3 consecutive days) after their second fixed annual cycle.


Other interventions: alemtuzumab
Alemtuzumab 12 mg/day IV infusion on 5 consecutive days if the participants had no prior alemtuzumab exposure (ie, first treatment course). All subsequent treatment courses were for 3 days only.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) - Relapse was defined as new neurological symptoms or worsening of previous neurological symptoms with an objective change on neurological examination, attributable to multiple sclerosis (MS) that last for at least 48 hours, present at normal body temperature, and that were preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability. ARR was obtained from the total number of confirmed relapses that occurred during the treatment follow-up time of all participants divided by the sum of follow-up time of all participants involved in certain treatment groups. ARR was estimated through negative binomial regression with robust variance estimation.</outcome>

      <outcome>Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) Before and After Receiving Alemtuzumab - Relapse was defined as new neurological symptoms or worsening of previous neurological symptoms with an objective change on neurological examination, attributable to MS that last for at least 48 hours, present at normal body temperature, and that were preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability. ARR was obtained from the total number of confirmed relapses that occurred during the treatment follow-up time of all participants divided by the sum of total follow-up time of all participants involved in certain treatment groups.

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Sustained Accumulation of Disability (SAD) - SAD: defined as an increase of at least 1.5 points in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score for participants with prior study baseline score of 0 and increase of at least 1.0 point for participants with a prior study baseline score of 1.0 or more; and the increase persisted over a 6-month consecutive period. EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that quantifies disability in participants with MS.

    <summary>This open-label, rater-blinded extension study enrolled participants who had
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and who participated in one of three prior
      Genzyme-sponsored studies of alemtuzumab (CAMMS223 [NCT00050778], CAMMS323 [NCT00530348] also
      known as CARE-MS I, or CAMMS324 [NCT00548405] also known as CARE-MS II). The purposes of this
      study were:

        1. To examine the long term safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab treatment in participants
           who received alemtuzumab as their study treatment in one of the prior studies.

        2. To examine the safety and efficacy of initial alemtuzumab treatment in this study for
           participants who received Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) as their study treatment in one of
           the prior studies.

        3. To determine the safety and efficacy of additional "as needed" alemtuzumab treatment
           courses. This applied both to participants who received alemtuzumab for the first time
           in one of the prior studies or for the first time in this extension study.</summary>
