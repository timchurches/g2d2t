Treatment: drugs - Lenvatinib matching placebo

Experimental: 24 mg Lenvatinib - Participants will receive 24 mg once daily (QD) as the starting dose. Dose reductions will occur in succession based on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, 10, or 8 mg QD). To maintain blinded treatment assignment, participants will be administered study drug in the form of two 10-mg capsules and two 4-mg capsules containing either lenvatinib or placebo (total of 4 capsules) to be taken orally, at approximately the same time each morning and may be taken in a fasting state or following a meal.

Experimental: 18 mg Lenvatinib - Participants will receive 18mg QD as the starting dose. Dose reductions will occur in succession based on the previous dose level (18,14, 10, 8, or 4 mg QD). To maintain blinded treatment assignment, participants will be administered study drug in the form of two 18, 14, 10, 8 mg capsules and two 4-mg capsules containing either lenvatinib or placebo (total of 4 capsules) to be taken orally, at approximately the same time each morning and may be taken in a fasting state or following a meal.

                  computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI). If there is only 1
                  target lesion and it is a non-lymph node, it should have a longest diameter of
                  =1.5 cm.

                  such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation must show evidence of progressive disease
                  based on RECIST 1.1 to be deemed a target lesion.

          3. Participants must show evidence of disease progression within 12 months (an additional
             month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates of performance of screening scans,
             ie, within =13 months) prior to signing informed consent, according to RECIST 1.1
             assessed and confirmed by central radiographic review of CT and/or MRI scans.

             following:

               1. One or more measurable lesions that do not demonstrate iodine uptake on any
                  radioiodine scan.

               2. One or more measurable lesions that have progressed according to RECIST 1.1
                  within 12 months (an additional month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates
                  of performance of screening scans, ie, within =13 months) after Iodine-131
                  therapy, despite demonstration of radioiodine avidity at the time of that
                  treatment by pre- or posttreatment scanning. These participants must not be
                  eligible for possible curative surgery.

          6. Participants must be receiving thyroxine suppression therapy and thyroid stimulating
             hormone (TSH) should not be elevated (TSH should be =5.50 mcIU/ML). When tolerated by
             the participant, thyroxine dose should be changed to achieve TSH suppression (TSH
             &lt;0.50 mcIU/ML) and this dose may be changed concurrently upon starting study drug
             treatment.

          7. All chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities must have resolved to Grade &lt;2
             severity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03), except

               3. Hemoglobin =9.0 g/dL

         12. Adequate blood coagulation function as evidenced by an International Normalized Ratio
             (INR) =1.5.

         13. Adequate liver function:

               1. Bilirubin =1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) except for unconjugated
                  hyperbilirubinemia or Gilbert's syndrome.

                  (in presence of liver metastases) AND the participant also is known to have bone
                  metastases, the liver-specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the
                  total and used to assess the liver function instead of total alkaline
                  phosphatase.

         14. Males or females age =18 years at the time of informed consent.

             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of
             25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG. A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug.

         16. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically

         17. Females of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant and use highly
             effective contraception while on treatment with lenvatinib and for at least 1 month
             after finishing treatment. Females of childbearing potential must not have had
             unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use
             a highly effective method of contraception (eg, total abstinence, an intrauterine
             device, a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner
             with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after
             study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have
             been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks
             before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for
             30 days after study drug discontinuation. Women using oral hormonal contraceptives
             should add a barrier method.

    <summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study being conducted as a postmarketing
      requirement to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate whether there is a lower
      starting dosage of lenvatinib 24 mg once daily (QD) that provides comparable efficacy but has
      a better safety profile in participants with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid
      cancer RR-DTC with radiographic evidence of disease progression within the prior 12 months.</summary>
