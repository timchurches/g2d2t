  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Tecemotide (L-BLP25)
Treatment: drugs - Single low dose cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Tecemotide (L-BLP25) - 

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 


Other interventions: Tecemotide (L-BLP25)
After receiving cyclophosphamide, participants will receive 8 consecutive weekly subcutaneous vaccinations with 806 microgram (mcg) of tecemotide (L-BLP25) at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 followed by maintenance vaccinations with 806 mcg of tecemotide (L-BLP25) at 6-week intervals, commencing at Week 13, until disease progression is documented.

Treatment: drugs: Single low dose cyclophosphamide
A single intravenous infusion of 300 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) (to a maximum 600 mg) of cyclophosphamide will be given 3 days before first tecemotide (L-BLP25) vaccination.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
A single infusion (IV) of 0.9% Saline solution instead of cyclophosphamide but in the same calculated dose will be given three days before first placebo vaccination. Subjects will then receive eight consecutive weekly subcutaneous vaccinations with placebo at weeks 0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6 and 7 followed by maintenance placebo vaccinations at 6-week intervals, commencing at week 13, until disease progression is documented.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival time was defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants without events were censored at the last date they were known to be alive or the clinical cut-off date, whatever was earlier.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 66 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time To Symptom Progression (TTSP) as Measured by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) - Time to symptom progression (TTSP) was measured by LCSS. Symptomatic progression was defined as an increase (worsening) of the Average Symptomatic Burden Index (ASBI that is, the mean of the six major lung cancer specific symptom scores of the LCSS patient scale - ranging from 0 to 100 where higher score indicates worst outcome). Worsening was defined as a 10% increase in the scale breadth from the baseline score. TTSP is defined as the time from randomization to worsening in ASBI. Participants without event are censored at the date of the last LCSS assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 66 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time To Progression (TTP) - Time from randomization to disease progression. Disease progression was defined based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.0 [RECIST v1.0]) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from nadir, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 66 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>One-, Two- and Three-year Survival Rate - The percentages of participants who were alive at 1, 2, and 3 years were calculated as a cumulative percentage by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis approach.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Years 1, 2, and 3</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Injection Site Reactions - Treatment -emergent adverse events were defined as those with onset or worsening occurring at or after the first dosing day of study medication and up to 42 days after the last administration of any study drug or the clinical cut-off date. Injection site reactions were reported as assessed by the Investigator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From first dose up to 42 days after the last dose of the trial treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the cancer vaccine tecemotide (L-BLP25) in
      addition to best supportive care is effective in prolonging the lives of subjects with
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer, compared to best supportive care alone.

      A local ancillary (sub) study in European centers will evaluate the immune response in
      peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.</summary>
