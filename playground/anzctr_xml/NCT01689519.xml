  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival - Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever came first. Disease progression was defined as: (1) at least a 20% increase in the sum (the increase in the sum must be at least 5 mm) of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum during the study; (2) unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; or (3) the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to the 09 May 2014 data cut-off (up to 1 year, 4 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of death from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to the 09 May 2014 data cut-off (up to 1 year, 4 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response - An objective response was defined as a complete response or a partial response determined on two consecutive occasions = 4 weeks apart. Responses were determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions or the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. A partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to the 09 May 2014 data cut-off (up to 1 year, 4 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Duration of response was defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response until the time of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 or death from any cause during the study. Disease progression was defined as: (1) at least a 20% increase in the sum (the increase in the sum must be at least 5 mm) of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum during the study; (2) unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; or (3) the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to the 09 May 2014 data cut-off (up to 1 year, 4 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (Final Analysis) - Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of death from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to the 28 August 2015 Overall Survival data cut-off (up to 2 years, 8 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
