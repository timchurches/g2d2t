  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression free survival (PFS) - PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be determined based on tumor assessment (RECIST version 1.1 criteria) as per Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) and survival information. The local Investigator's assessments will be used as supportive analyses.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to definitive 1 point deterioration in ECOG performance status - Time to definitive 1 point deterioration in the ECOG PS is defined as the time form date of randomization to definitive deterioration, where deterioration is considered as definitive if no improvement in the ECOG PS status is observed at a subsequent time of measurement during the treatment period following the time point where the deterioration is observed.</outcome>

    <summary>This is 2-part, randomized, open label, multi-center, parallel group, phase III study
      comparing the efficacy and safety of LGX818 plus MEK162 to vemurafenib and LGX818 monotherapy
      in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600
      mutation. A total of approximately 900 patients will be randomized.

      Part 1:

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment arms:

        1. LGX818 450 mg QD plus MEK162 45 mg BID (denoted as Combo 450 arm)

        2. LGX818 300 mg QD monotherapy (denoted as LGX818 arm) or

        3. vemurafenib 960 mg BID (denoted as vemurafenib arm)

      Part 2:

      Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms:

        1. LGX818 300 mg QD plus MEK162 45 mg BID (denoted as Combo 300 arm) or

        2. LGX818 300 mg QD monotherapy (denoted as LGX818 arm)</summary>
