  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study was a randomized control trial with a cross-over design involving the use of take home MP3 players and in-ear phones, containing recorded predictable and unpredictable tinnitus relief sounds, which the participant listened to for a minimum of one hour per day for sixteen weeks (8 weeks predictable, 8 weeks unpredictable sounds). All stimuli (predictable and unpredictable sounds) were adjusted for sound level such that long-term average loudness (dB SPL) was equivalent. There was a three week wash-out period in between the two conditions.

 13 participants were administered the Predictable condition first and 12 participants administered the Unpredictable condition first. All participants were tested by the student investigator throughout the trial. Adherence to intervention was monitored by email communication every two weeks (beginning with the date of sound fitting) which asked participants how the sound trial was going, if they have any concerns or queries, any special circumstances, etc. In-between follow-up appointments were made as needed. The interviews at each follow-up appointment also monitored adherence and addressed any concerns which arose. 

Predictable sound therapy

a) Broadband noise (BBN) set at the volume such that it was comfortable, and at the minimal level at which the sound started to interfere with their tinnitus. 

b) Frequency of stimulation: Minimum 1 hour per day for 8 continuous weeks

d) Mode of administration: MP3 file participants listened to using a Phillips ViBe 4GB MP3 player + Panasonic in-ear phones (RP-HJE290) with Budloks Sport Grip

Unpredictable sound therapy

a) Beach surf, Cicadas/Farm Sounds and Rain sounds directly recorded from the natural setting by the researchers and edited. Participants selected which sound they preferred to use in the trial. In use participants were asked to set the volume of sound such that it was comfortable, and at the minimal level at which the sound started to interfere with their tinnitus.

b) Frequency of stimulation: Minimum 1 hour per day for 8 continuous weeks

d) Mode of administration: MP3 file participants listened to using a Phillips ViBe 4GB MP3
player + Panasonic in-ear phones (RP-HJE290) with Budloks Sport Grip</interventions>

    <concealment>Existing volunteers from the University of Auckland Tinnitus Database were approached via email – a participant information sheet (PIS) and consent form (CF) were attached along with the study invite. These were individuals who have expressed interest in participating in tinnitus research. Interested individuals contacted the student investigator by email or phone.</concealment>
    <sequence>The order of Intervention presentation (Order 1 = Predictable then Unpredictable OR Order 2 = Unpredictable then Predictable) for participants was decided using an online, free True Random Number Generator (https://www.random.org/). Each participant was given a code number from 1-24. Participants whose codes matched the first 17 generations of the random sequence were assigned Order 1, the remaining participants were assigned into Order 2.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>All participants were tested by the same researcher throughout the trial. The only blinding applied was participants were not shown the results of their tinnitus outcome measures at the different time points until the end of the trial. Blinding to intervention type could be given due to the distinct perceptual sound characteristics of the two sound stimuli. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on Wise et al. (2012, Unpublished thesis) data for tinnitus population variance for a significant change of 13 on TFI, with mean 28.15 and standard deviation 17.1 (one-tailed), significance 0.05 and power 0.8, the sample size needed was 11 (Wise, 2012). 25 participants were therefore determined as being sufficient for this trial.

The difference between the two groups in mean changes in the intervention outcome between 4 and 8 weeks of intervention and baseline were obtained using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for baseline. Covariates of age, gender, and degree of hearing loss (categorized as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound (ASHA, American Speech and Hearing Association) (Clark, 1981) based on average of 3000, 4000 and 6000 Hz hearing thresholds bilaterally) were also added in a second model and re-run for 4 weeks and 8 weeks follow-up. In cases where a significant main effect was observed, Bonferroni post-hoc tests were administered.

The framework method (Gale et al., 2013) was used to analyse the qualitative interviews, consisting of five steps: familiarization, identification of a thematic framework, indexing, charting, and mapping and interpretation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mechanisms of tinnitus (phantom sound) perception and sound therapy (treating tinnitus using sounds) are still poorly understood. Understanding such mechanisms can enable for
developing better interventions/treatments for tinnitus sufferers. It is of interest to administer a randomized control sound therapy trial comparing the effectiveness of predictable and unpredictable sounds for tinnitus relief. It is also of interest to see how the emotional component of sounds may influence its effectiveness as a tinnitus treatment sound. Aim: Understand how sound therapy of long-term duration using predictable and unpredictable sounds affects tinnitus characteristics. Hypotheses: Administration of unpredictable sound therapy will result in lower tinnitus loudness and distress outcomes than predictable sound therapy. Tinnitus treatment sounds which evoke positive, relaxed emotions (high valence) will result in lower tinnitus loudness and distress outcomes than static, neutral sounds.</summary>
