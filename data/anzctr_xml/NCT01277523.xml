    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria:

          1. All patients and their parent(s) (or legally accepted representative) must sign and
             date respectively an informed assent and an informed consent consistent with
             International Conference on Harmonisation - Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good
             Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and local legislation prior to the patient's

             into the trial.

          4. All patients must have been on maintenance treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid
             either at stable high dose in combination with another controller medication, OR at
             stable medium dose in combination with two other controller medications, for at least
             4 weeks before Visit 1.

          5. All patients must be symptomatic at Visit 1 (screening) and prior to randomisation at

             400 µg salbutamol (albuterol). If patients in the lower age range (e.g. 12 to 14 year
             old patients) exhibit a very small total lung volume, positive reversibility testing
             might be based solely on the relative (=12%) post-bronchodilator response.

          9. All patients must be never-smokers or ex-smokers who stopped smoking at least one year
             prior to enrolment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall purpose of the trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of tiotropium inhalation
      solution delivered via Respimat® inhaler (2.5 mcg and 5 mcg once daily) over 12 weeks,
      compared to placebo, as add-on controller therapy on top of usual care in adolescents (12 to
      17 years old) with severe persistent asthma.

      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate superiority of tiotropium (5 mcg and
      possibly 2.5 mcg once daily in the evening) over placebo with regard to the primary pulmonary
      function endpoint after 12 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate efficacy of tiotropium with regard to other endpoints,
      and to evaluate the safety of tiotropium, compared to placebo, as add-on controller therapy
      on top of usual care in this patient population.</summary>
