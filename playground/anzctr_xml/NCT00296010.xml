    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - methotrexate
Treatment: drugs - pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
Treatment: surgery - adjuvant therapy
Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: CASA-nil PLD - Adjuvant pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) for 16 weeks

Active Comparator: CASA-Nil - No adjuvant therapy

Experimental: CASA-CM PLD - Adjuvant pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) for 16 weeks

Active Comparator: CASA-CM CM - Low-dose, metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM) for 16 weeks


Treatment: drugs: cyclophosphamide
cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day orally continuously for 16 weeks

Treatment: drugs: methotrexate
methotrexate 2.5 mg twice a day orally on days 1 and 4 of every week for 16 weeks

Treatment: drugs: pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
Caelyx (R) (Doxil (R)) 20 mg/m2 iv x 8 doses (delivered every 2 weeks)

Treatment: surgery: adjuvant therapy


Treatment: other: radiation therapy
Radiation therapy should be used according to institutional accepted guidelines. Radiation therapy to the conserved breast is recommended. Radiation therapy to the chest wall following mastectomy is optional (if given, it may also include nodal fields). Radiation therapy may be given either during operation or after all chemotherapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and liposomal
      doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor
      cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving liposomal doxorubicin
      after surgery is more effective than observation or cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in
      treating breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying liposomal doxorubicin to see how well it
      works compared with observation or cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in treating older women
      who have undergone surgery for breast cancer.</summary>
