  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is a serious, life-threatening, bile acid related liver
      disease of unknown cause. Without treatment, it frequently progresses to liver fibrosis and
      eventual cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation or resulting in death. The investigational
      drug, Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a modified bile acid and FXR agonist that is derived from the
      primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid. The key mechanisms of action of OCA, including
      its choleretic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties, underlie its
      hepatoprotective effects and result in attenuation of injury and improved liver function in a
      cholestatic liver disease such as PBC. The study will assess the effect of OCA compared to
      placebo, combined with stable standard care, on clinical outcomes in PBC patients.</summary>
