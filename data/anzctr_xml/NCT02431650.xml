    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - OZ439
Treatment: drugs - Primaquine

Experimental: OZ439 - Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~2,800 viable parasites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (BSPC) administered intravenously. when PCR quantification of all participants is = 5,000 parasites/mL, they will receive a single dose of 480 mg of piperaquine phosphate to clear blood stage parasitemia. When gametocytemia is at the peak (approximately 15 days after administration of piperaquine), participants will be randomised to receive either OZ439 or a control group (primaquine treatment).
In the first cohort 500 mg OZ439 will be administered as a single dose. Doses used in subsequent cohort(s) will be determined following a review of observed safety and pharmacodynamic drug effects.

Active Comparator: Primaquine - Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~2,800 viable parasites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (BSPC) administered intravenously. when PCR quantification of all participants is = 5,000 parasites/mL, they will receive a single dose of 480 mg of piperaquine phosphate to clear blood stage parasitemia. When gametocytemia is at the peak (approximately 15 days after administration of piperaquine), participants will be randomised to receive either OZ439 or a control group (primaquine treatment).
Primaquine is a positive control for OZ439, to be administered 15 mg as a single dose.

             laboratory norm and haemoglobin must be equal or higher than the lower limit of the
             normal range, - - As there is the risk of adverse effects of OZ439, Riamet and
             primaquine in early pregnancy, it is important that any participants involved in this
             study do not get pregnant or get their female partners pregnant.

             detected drug).

          -  Vital signs outside the reference range and considered as clinically significant by

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single-centre, controlled, open label study using P. falciparum-induced blood stage
      malaria (IBSM) infection to assess the effectiveness of OZ439 as a gametocytocidal agent, as
      well as its treatment effects on gametocyte infectivity and development in vector mosquitoes.
      Previous clinical studies including one IBSM study have shown that in addition to effectively
      clearing replicating, asexual (pathogenic) life cycle stages of malaria, a single dose of
      piperaquine (480 mg) results in the production of gametocytes, as determined by
      gametocyte-specific transcript (pfs25) qPCR. The propensity of piperaquine to induce
      gametocytaemia will be employed in this study to assess the efficacy of OZ439 as a
      gametocytocidal and transmission blocking agent. Experimental mosquito feeding via both
      direct feeding on participants and artificial (indirect) membrane mosquito feeding will be
      performed. The study will be conducted in up to 3 cohorts where participants will be
      randomised into an experimental or a control group (n=2 per group) when peak gametocytemia
      occurs (approximately 15 days after administration of piperaquine).</summary>
