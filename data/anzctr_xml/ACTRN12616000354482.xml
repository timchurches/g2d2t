  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will examine the effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on IR in men and  women with metabolic syndrome. 
This research will be a randomized controlled trial in Armidale for 12 weeks. Men aged between 18 to 70 years with metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome women with or without PCOS aged between 18 to 70 years will be recruited and randomly allocated to the high intensity interval training group (HIIT G) or the control group (CG). HIIT G participants will undergo supervised HIIT on bicycle ergometers 3 times/week.
A HIIT session will be:
5 min warm up (low intensity exercise performed at 50% VO2 max)
3 sets of HIIT for 20 seconds (3×20) performed at 95% VO2 max, 2 min low intensity exercise at 30% VO2 after each HIIT set
5 min cool down at 30% VO2 max
Stretching of hamstrings, quadriceps, hip adductors, hip abductors and calf muscles for a total time period of 3 minutes.
CG will continue with their usual care and will not participate in HIIT sessions. The mode of administration will be one-on-one consultation. The intervention will be administered by an exercise physiologist. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A previous meta-analysis of lifestyle intervention on PCOS and sample size calculation was conducted in 2013. A sample size calculator tool kit with average two samples was used. 
https://www.dssresearch.com/knowledgecenter/toolkitcalculators/samplesizecalculators.aspx 
This website was accessed on 10th August 2013. These calculations also included an adjustment of 20%, regarding participants withdrawing early from future study. The sample size calculation for 1% level of significance was 25 in each intervention and comparator group and a total of 50 participants. Allowing 15-20% participant withdrawal a total of 60 PCOS women would be required to reach 1% level of significance. 
The corresponding number for 5% level of significance was 16 PCOS women in each intervention and comparator group, a total of 32 women should be recruited. Allowing 15-20% of participant withdrawal rates as seen in most of the included studies 40 PCOS women should be recruited to reach 5% statistical significance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to examine the benefits of HIIT on insulin resistance in men and women with metabolic syndrome.

Research Hypothesis 
HIIT induces metabolic changes and improves IR, glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism
HIIT induced regulation of insulin will reduce androgen production
HIIT enhances skeletal muscle oxidative capacity 

Aims 
To accomplish the primary purpose of this study the following assessments will be conducted:- 
1. Evaluate the percentage of change in body composition parameters. 
2. Assess the level of change in hormonal parameters.
3. Assess the level of change in blood glycaemic parameters 
4. Evaluate the level of change in blood lipid profile
5. Evaluate the percentage of improvement in parameters of cardiovascular fitness, heart rate variability and telomere length.

Research Plan
This research will examine the benefits of HIIT on IR in metabolic syndrome men and women. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Armidale for 12 weeks. Men aged between 18 to 70 years with metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome women with or without PCOS aged between 18 to 70 years will be recruited and randomly allocated to the high intensity interval training group (HIIT G) or the control group (CG). Two information and screening sessions will be conducted for participants before the intervention. Information regarding HIIT, exercise testing procedures, blood tests and the intervention study will be discussed.
Participants will be asked to complete a health questionnaire. Based on the information provided by the participant and the health questionnaire, decision will be made on eligibility for participation. During the screening session consent forms will be signed. HIIT G participants will undergo supervised high intensity exercise training on bicycle ergometers 3 times/week.
A HIIT session will be a 5 min warm up, 3 sets of HIIT for 20 seconds (3×20), 2 minutes of low intensity exercise after each HIIT set, 5 min cool down period and stretching.
Participants assigned to the control group will continue with their usual care and will not participate in supervised exercise sessions. Both intervention groups will be provided with an activity journal to record their daily physical activity. Pre training assessment for peak VO2 will be done using an incremental exercise test on an exercise bike. Heart rate will be monitored during each exercise session. Measurements for body composition, blood essays for glycaemic markers, hormones and lipids will be conducted at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 week post intervention completion.
