  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants to participate in a six week home exercise programme dependent on group randomly assigned; hip stretching, hip strengthening and hip rotation only groups.

The hip stretching and hip strengthening groups perform the rotation exercises in addition to the stretching and strengthening exercises.

Arm 1:
In the stretching group, exercises focused on a variety of stretches through a large range of hip positions aimed at stretching the entire hip capsule, ligaments and surrounding musculature (Hewitt, RRGlisson, Guilak, &amp; Vail, 2002; Hidaka et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2008; Walker, 2007).  Six stretches in addition to the two rotation exercises (eight in total) were performed.  The stretches were (1) hip external rotation in crook lying, (2) hip flexion and abduction in crook lying (3) lunge hip flexor stretch (4) hip external rotation, flexion and abduction in sitting (5) standing long groin stretch and, (6) sitting short groin stretch. Stretching exercises were done once a day, 5 times a week, for six weeks.  Stretches were held for 30 sec and repeated 3 times.

Arm 2:
In the strengthening group, exercises focused on strengthening the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and short hip external rotators muscles, which were progressed throughout the intervention period.  This was achieved by increasing repetitions, increasing difficulty of exercises or addition of theraband (Bolga &amp; Uhl, 2005; Distefano, Blackburn, Marshall, &amp; Padua, 2009; Ekstrom, Donatelli, &amp; Carp, 2007; Snyder, Earl, OConnor, &amp; Ebersole, 2009). Strengthening exercises were done once a day, 3 times a week, for six weeks.  Weeks one and two exercises consisted of (1) clams, (2) prone hip external rotation with theraband, (3) side-lying hip abduction, (4) quadruped hip extension, and (5) single leg stand.  Weeks three and four exercises consisted of (1) quadruped hip extension, (2) quadruped hip abduction/ external rotation, (3) single leg bridge, (4) single leg squats, (5) lateral step exercise, and (6) standing hip rotation exercise.  Weeks five and six exercises consisted of (1) quadruped hip extension, (2) quadruped hip abduction/ external rotation, (3) single leg squats, (4) single leg bridge, (5) lateral step exercise, and (6) standing hip rotation exercise with theraband.  Exercises were performed 10 to 15 reps, 2 to 3 sets.</interventions>
    <comparator>The hip rotation only group performs only hip rotation exercises once a day, 5 times a week, for six weeks. Each exercise was held for 30 sec and repeated 3 times.
The exercise consisted of active hip internal rotation and external rotation stretching in prone with participants instructed to perform movement without moving their pelvis or back.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria for this study were people with non-specific chronic or recurrent low back pain with reduced hip rotation range of movement.  Chronic low back pain was defined as symptoms present on greater than half the days in a 12-month period, occurring in a single or in a multiple episodes (Von Korff, 1994).  Recurrent low back pain was defined as symptoms present on less than half of the days in a 12-month period, occurring in multiple episodes over the year (Von Korff, 1994). 

Hip rotation range of movement was measured passively in prone using a standard goniometer.
Passive rotation range of movement was assessed to eliminate lumbopelvic movement that may occur with active hip rotation (Gombatto, Collins, Sahrmann, Engsberg, &amp; Van Dillen, 2006).  Reduced hip rotation range of movement was either reduced internal rotation or external rotation (&lt;30º) (Burns, et al., 2011).</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this current study was to assess which type of exercise targeted at the hip is effective in people with low back pain.  Due to the relationship of reduced hip rotation range of movement and low back pain, patients were included in the study if they displayed reduced hip rotation range of movement.  Hip rotation exercises were compared to additional hip stretching and hip strengthening exercises to determine which group would improve in pain and function.  A secondary aim of this study was also to investigate whether an increase in hip rotation range of movement positively correlated to an improvement in low back pain outcomes.</summary>
