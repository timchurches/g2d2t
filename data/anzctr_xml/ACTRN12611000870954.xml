  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cancer cachexia is a syndrome of progressive weight loss, anorexia, and persistent reduction of body cell mass in response to a malignant tumour. In cancer cachexia there is the extensive loss of adipose tissue and equal amounts of skeletal muscle mass. The incidence of cachexia is type of tumour and site dependent. Small-Cell and NSCLC patients experience a high incidence of cachexia, 57% and 61% respectively. It is associated with a deterioration of functional status and quality of life and is also associated with poor survival. Muscle wasting is the main cause of impaired function, leading to respiratory complications and fatigue.There is a need to support cachectic lung cancer patients after their chemotherapeutic regimens, especially with the added knowledge that chemotherapy treatment will add to their overall weight loss and cachectic state. The optimal treatment for cancer cachexia is the complete removal of the tumour; unfortunately with many advanced solid tumours this is unachievable, especially in the case of NSCLC patients. The next best options are to increase nutritional intake to counteract the weight loss, address the anorexia, inflammation, and the metabolic alterations i.e. loss of body fat and the skeletal muscle wasting. This study aims to identify a novel treatment</summary>
